# If escapes makes an agent winner while there are healing agents the healing agents LOOKS are lost
## Summary
When escapes happen in a level to make some agent winner (only active agent in the game) while there are some healing agents the game will be over and the healing agents lost their heal cost.
## Vulnerability Detail
Assume there are 50 active agents alive in the game and 15 healing agents. Assume that Alice is the owner of the all 50 agents and she sees that there are 15 healing agents. Those healers already paid the equivalent LOOKS to have a chance to be alive in the next round. Alice can take advantage of this situation and escapes her 49 agents making the game over. Those 15 healing agents LOOKS are sent to Alice and their heal didn't do what it supposed to.

Note that Alice having ownership of the last 50 active agents is not a must. This scenario can happen without having such a power but would be more unlikely because of the nature of competition. 
## Impact
As stated above the scenario is possible and there is a loss of funds possibility for all those healers. Considering the possibility of such scenarios happening and the funds lost I will label this as medium

## Recommendation
Do not let the game to be over when there are pending heal requests to have a fair competition for the players
