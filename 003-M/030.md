# `InfiltrationPeriphery::heal` users can lose surplus of ETH sent to slippage
## Summary
`InfiltrationPeriphery::heal` enables a user to heal agents using ETH, and helps by swapping the ETH amount provided to LOOKS (which is used to pay for the healing). However even though the maximum amount paid in ETH is bounded by `msg.value`, a user can pay more than needed, because the slippage parameter is set to zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
See the function `InfiltrationPeriphery::heal`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/InfiltrationPeriphery.sol#L41-L70

The parameter `sqrtPriceLimitX96` is set to zero, which means that ETH/LOOKS price can be very high, and use all of `msg.value`, even if it was not intended to by the original user (when a user provides surplus eth, it is returned to him by the periphery).

In the scenario when a user provides a surplus of ETH to ensure his tx will not revert, a malicious front-runner can take advantage and sandwich the swap.

## Impact
A user providing a surplus of ETH during healing with periphery may lose it

## Recommendation
Use an alternative price source such as chainlink and check price deviation against it
