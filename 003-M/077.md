# Lack of slippage for `heal()` can cause huge financial loss for users
## Summary
Users can choose to heal their agent when it is wounded. But the only allowed parameter is the `agentId`. It does not allow users to specify the maximum amount they are willing to pay for the heal.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue here is that the cost of healing doubles for each heal that has been made. Users will always want to pay a lower cost. Because of the missing slippage check, users can potentially be forced to pay more than 2x the cost they are willing to pay.

Assuming 0.08 USDC LOOKS price ( current price )

1. User sees the cost to heal is 500 LOOKS ( $40 USDC )
2. User calls the function heal
3. 2 other users happen to heal in the same block before the vulnerable user
4. Price now is 2000 LOOKS ( $160 USDC )
5. User pays 4x more than he is willing to

## Impact
Due to cost of healing doubles every heal, the cost increases exponentially and can quickly rise beyond what a user is willing to pay for, hence causing huge losses to the user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a maximum amount of LOOKS token in the `heal()` function, so that users can control and specify how much they are willing to pay for the heal.
