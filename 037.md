# Potential Vulnerabilities
## Summary

The smart contract code has several areas where improvements are required to ensure data integrity and prevent potential attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

**Unchecked Array Indexing:**
The function `_healRequestFulfilled` does not ensure that `healingAgentIdsCount` is within the bounds of the `healingAgentIds` array, which can lead to out-of-bounds access.
## Impact

Out-of-bounds access could lead to incorrect data being read or written, which could corrupt the contract state or lead to unexpected behavior.

## Code Snippet

[Code location](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/CONTRACTS/InfiltrationPeriphery.sol#L1353-L17)
// @audit-issue: Unchecked array indexing can lead to out-of-bounds access.
uint256 healingAgentId = healingAgentIds[i.unsafeAdd(1)];

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement bounds checking to ensure that the index is within the valid range before accessing the array.
Consider using a library or utility function to handle array access in a safe manner.
