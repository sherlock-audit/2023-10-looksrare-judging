# Re-request for randomness is a security anti-pattern.
## Summary
When the `startGame()` function is called,  in the end of the function it makes a request for randomness via the `_requestForRandomness()` function and if the VRF does not respond to 24 hours, a new `_requestForRandomness()` can be send through `startNewRound()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
This goes against the security standards in using VRF, as stated in the [docs](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security#do-not-re-request-randomness):

`Re-requesting randomness is easily detectable on-chain and should be avoided for use cases that want to be considered as using VRFv2 correctly.`

## Impact
Basically, the service provider can withhold a VRF fulfillment until a new request that is favorable for them comes.

## Recommendation
Increase the waiting period to until the request has been fulfilled.
