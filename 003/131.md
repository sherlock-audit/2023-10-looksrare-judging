# Fairness of Randomness is threatened and possibilities for gaming the jackpot.
## Summary

Re-requesting randomness from VRF is a security pattern anti-pattern. This issue will show how the current implementation of ``startGame()`` goes directly against Chainlink's security Security Consideration of not re-requesting randomness  (https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security#do-not-re-request-randomness). 

## Vulnerability Detail

The ``fulfillRandomWords`` function calls internal functions ``_healRequestFulfilled`` , ``_woundRequestFulfilled``, and ``_killWoundedAgents``, which loops over the ``healingAgentIdsCount``, ``woundedAgentsCount`` and ``woundedAgentIdsCount``. This is a problem as the code might require a lot of gas and make the ``fulfillRandomWords`` revert it's execution, which is problem for the integration of VRF as listed in the [docs](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security#fulfillrandomwords-must-not-revert), since it should not be reverting. 

## Code Snippet

We can see that from the ``startGame`` function, ``_requestForRandomness`` is can be re ran in the case of a revert.

## Impact

Re-requesting randomness is achieved when there is a possible revert on the ``fulfillRandomWords`` function. Fairness of protocol is undermined.

## Recommendation

- Consider caching the randomness received and then letting an EOA to make the actual call the internal functions listed above, it can also set the correct gas amount.
