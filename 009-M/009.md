# The buyer of the winner's Infiltration NFT may face front-running risks, as the winner could claim the rewards before the Infiltration NFT is traded
## Summary

If the grand prize winner lists the winning Infiltration NFT on the secondary market and initiates their claiming transaction before the trade transaction occurs, the NFT buyer could potentially incur financial losses.


## Vulnerability Detail

As implemented in [`Infiltration.transferFrom`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/Infiltration.sol#L924), only Infiltration NFTs in the "Active" and "Wounded" states can be transferred or traded.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Only active and wounded agents are allowed to be transferred or traded.
     * @param from The current owner of the token.
     * @param to The new owner of the token.
     * @param tokenId The token ID.
     */
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public payable override {
        AgentStatus status = agents[agentIndex(tokenId)].status;
        if (status > AgentStatus.Wounded) {
            revert InvalidAgentStatus(tokenId, status);
        }
        super.transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);
    }
```

After a game ends, only the first-place player(the winenr) remains active, enabling the winner's NFT to be traded.
Considering the following scenario:

1. Alice wins the game and lists the NFT on the secondary market with less moeny than the prizes(including grand prize and secondary prize).
2. Bob decides to purchase the NFT, recognizing that it is profitable to trade and claim the prizes associated with it.
3. Alice monitors the mempool and submits a `claimGrandPrize` transaction just before Bobâ€™s purchase transaction.
4. Bob receives the NFT and calls to `claimGrandPrize` but this transaction would revert as the prizes have already been claimed by Alice. 
Consequently, Alice receives the prizes and the the amount of the transaction, while Bob is left with an empty NFT and no prizes.


To demonstrate this scenario, you can add the following test to `contracts-infiltration/test/foundry/Infiltration.claimGrandPrize.t.sol`. For the sake of simplicity, Alice will only call `claimGrandPrize` before transferring. **It's important to note that this scenario can arise not only from the grand prize but also from the secondary prizes.**

Run with `forge test --match-test test_transferWinner  -vv`, it will revert because the grand prize has been clamied by Alice.

## Impact

The buyer of the winner's Infiltration NFT will lose all their funds and receive only the claimed NFT.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation

To ensure the NFT's security, consider either burning the winner's NFT or marking its status as *"Dead"* after it has been claimed for both the grand prize and secondary prizes. This action will help prevent any further transactions or potential issues with the NFT.
