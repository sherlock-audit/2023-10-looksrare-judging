# A participant with enough active agents can force win for his wounded agents
## Summary
Infiltration contract decides the game is over when only one `Active` agent is left. The assumption is that the game will go through a round which is initialized with `number of agents < NUMBER_OF_SECONDARY_PRIZE_POOL_WINNERS`, such as all remaining wounded agents are killed at that point.

However if a participant has enough agents to escape, it may not be the case, and the participant can skip the `killing` of wounded agents and allow these agents to claim secondary prizes.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's examine the following scenario:
### Prerequisites
- NUMBER_OF_SECONDARY_PRIZE_POOL_WINNERS = 50
- Alice holds 20 active agents (ranked 31 to 51) and 20 wounded agents (ranked 1 to 20)
- Bob holds 1 active agent and 10 healing agents (ranked 20 to 31)
(Rankings are consecutive for simplicity of the example)

### Steps
1/ Alice escapes all of her active agents, freezing the ranks of all of the remaining alive agents.

> Note that since the game is over, Bob cannot call `startNewRound()` to initiate the killing of Alice's wounded agents:

2/ With her wounded agents, Alice can claim Grand prize, and top secondary prizes,
3/ Whereas with healing and last active agent, Bob can only claim lowest secondary prizes 

## Impact

Prizes are unfairly distributed, this is a loss of funds for honest participants

## Recommendation
Enforce the `cleaning` of wounded participants when game is over to claim grand prize
