# Infiltration cannot receive native token
## Summary

The InfiltrationPeriphery have a receive() method so that they can be funded from the swap router. But the Infiltration does not, and therefore it cannot be funded from the swap router.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Infiltration does not have a receive() method , and therefore it is incompatible with the native token.
On https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/InfiltrationPeriphery#34, LOOK is initialized with new instance of Infiltration.
And on  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/InfiltrationPeriphery#50 and https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/InfiltrationPeriphery#83, LOOK is used as tokenOut. 
So If Infiltration does not have a receive() method, it cannot be funded from SwapRouter.

## Impact

Infiltration cannot be funded from the swap router.
