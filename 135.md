# Game Creator might not start the actual game.
## Summary

The game creator is not actually required to start the game after the minting period. The execution of the game is in the hands of the contract owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

Once the minting period is over, the contract owner can execute the ``emergencyWithdraw`` function and obtain all of the funds. One of the 3 conditions for the ``emergencyWithdraw`` function is basically checking the ``currentRoundId`` is = 0 which means the game hasn't started, and also ensuring that the ``block.timestamp`` is 36 hours more than the ``mintEnd`` period which is the last time minting by users can be done.

This means that the ``emergencyWithdraw`` function can be used to withdraw the funds deposited after minting without actually starting the game. 

## Impact

Loss of jackpot and funds.

## Code Snippet

In the ``emergencyWithdraw`` function we can see that with condition 3, the contract owner can execute the function as long as the minting period has ended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- The ``startGame()`` function can be done without the access control, so that any user can start the game after the minting period.
- Create a refund function for user's so that they can withdraw their own deposited funds instead of an emergency withdraw function.
