# Unsafe `minimumRequestConfirmations`
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
According to [Chainlink's doc](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security#choose-a-safe-block-confirmation-time-which-will-vary-between-blockchains):
> You must choose an appropriate confirmation time for the randomness requests you make. Confirmation time is how many blocks the VRF service waits before writing a fulfillment to the chain to make potential rewrite attacks unprofitable in the context of your application and its value-at-risk.

`Infiltration.sol` uses 3 as the minimumRequestConfirmations: 

    uint256 requestId = VRF_COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords({
            keyHash: KEY_HASH,
            subId: SUBSCRIPTION_ID,
            minimumRequestConfirmations: uint16(3),
            callbackGasLimit: uint32(2_500_000),
            numWords: uint32(1)
        });

Actually, 3 is the minimum number of confirmations supported by ChainLink, but it is not fully secure for Ethereum network.
For example, Binance waits 6 blocks to confirm a deposit and OKX waits 12 blocks to confirm a deposit.
To make sure a block is no uncle or a transaction included in a block does not hang up in an ommer, I would suggest waiting 7 confirmations (around 2 minutes). From the [Ethereum whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/#modified-ghost-implementation):
> Ethereum implements a simplified version of GHOST which only goes down seven levels. Specifically, it is defined as follows:
A block must specify a parent, and it must specify 0 or more uncles
An uncle included in block B must have the following properties:
It must be a direct child of the kth generation ancestor of B, where 2 <= k <= 7.
It cannot be an ancestor of B
An uncle must be a valid block header, but does not need to be a previously verified or even valid block
An uncle must be different from all uncles included in previous blocks and all other uncles included in the same block (non-double-inclusion)

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use 7 blocks instead of 3.
