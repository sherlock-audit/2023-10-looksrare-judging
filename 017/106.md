# Front-running heal function
## Summary

The `heal` function, intended to facilitate healing of wounded agents, is susceptible to be front-run and revert due to a status check that causes the entire transaction to revert if any single agent in the batch is not in the expected wounded status.

## Vulnerability Detail

`heal()` performs a status check for each agent to ensure they are eligible for healing by being in a wounded state. This check is done through `_assertAgentStatus()`, which reverts the transaction if the status condition is not met

Imagine the scenario where Alice who has `100` agents, attempts to heal `20` agents wounded, an attacker, Bob, can observe the transaction in the mempool and send a transaction with a higher gas price to heal one of the `20` Alice's agents
If Bob's transaction is confirmed first, the status of the agent changes, and when Alice's transaction is processed, it fails due to the status check, causing her to lose the gas spent on the transaction and leaving her agents at risk for another round
Suppose 15 of the agents were wounded at `currentRoundId-ROUNDS_TO_BE_WOUNDED_BEFORE_DEAD` and Bob performs it's attack until enough block pass to be able to call `startNewRound()`, 15 of Alice's agents will be killed in `fulfillRandomWords()`

## Impact

- loss of gas for Alice 
- Alice agents killed without any chance to survive or at least increased risk of Alice's agents being killed next round

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I think it's important to allow anyone to heal anyone agents so simply continue the loop for healing if one of the agents status of `uint256[] calldata agentIds` is not `status.wounded`
