# Owner can't claim prize when winner burn their NFT
## Summary

Owner can't claim their price in case of they burn their NFT.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the winner burn their NFT, the owner can't claim prize because the `Infiltration` contract depends on the NFT ownership to claim the price by calling `Infiltration#claimGrandPrize` and `Infiltration#claimSecondaryPrizes` functions. So when the winner burn their NFT, they can't claim prize anymore.

## Impact

The winner can't claim NFT after they burn their NFT.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend storing the winner parameter. Add try-catch blocks to each `_assertAgentOwnership` call. If the call reverts then use storing the winner parameter to transfer price to winner directly.
