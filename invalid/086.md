# Unchecked arithmetic usage in `Infiltration`'s healing and escaping mechanism allows for direct bypass of >0.8.0 solidity's built-in checks due to `UnsafeMathUint256`
## Summary

`Infiltration.sol` uses a library called `UnsafeMathUint256` for arithmetic operations, which deliberately bypasses Solidity's built-in overflow checks introduced in version >0.8.0. The unsafe arithmetic functions can be exploited by an attacker to cause overflows or underflows, easily leading to incorrect state updates or bypassing of critical checks.

## Vulnerability Detail

Within the `Infiltration` CA, arithmetic operations are carried out using `UnsafeMathUint256`'s functions such as `unsafeAdd`, `unsafeSubtract`, `unsafeMultiply`, and `unsafeDivide`. These functions do not use Solidity's check for arithmetic overflow/underflow, which can result in wrapping of values and lead to unintended behavior.

The primary concern with this approach is that it opens up the possibility of an attacker crafting inputs or txns that manipulate the state variables of the CA, leading to:

* Manipulation of token balances
* Bypassing of limitations on the number of tokens that can be minted
* Incorrect calculation of rewards or game logic due to manipulated agent statuses

For instance, in the `heal` function, there is a loop that calculates the cost of healing agents based on the number of times an agent has been healed previously, which can overflow if `healCount` becomes too large:

```solidity
cost += _costToHeal(agent.healCount);
```

The `_costToHeal` function uses the `unsafeMultiply` function from `UnsafeMathUint256`. Furthermore, since the cost of healing increases exponentially with each additional heal (`cost = HEAL_BASE_COST * (2 ** healCount)`), it would only require a `healCount` of 256 for the cost to exceed the maximum value that can be represented by a `uint256`, resulting in an overflow and thus a much lower `heal` cost than expected.

Though if we consider the use of unsafe math within exclusively the `startGame`, the behavior would be quite different as that's apparently an `onlyOwner` function, so assuming the owner is trusted there should be no risk there, yet the danger overly lies within the `heal` and the way the healing mechanism is currently structured. 
The game's critical logic relies on the accurate tracking of agent statuses, rounds, and other state variables. An overflow/underflow in any of these can corrupt the game state, eventually leading to the siphoning off of rewards or the disruption of the overall game's economy.

## Impact

The unchecked arithmetic operations pose a high risk, as they can lead to:

1. Loss or creation of funds due to the inaccurate calculation of balances or costs.
2. Disruption of the game mechanics, which could render the game unfair or inoperable.
3. Possible theft of tokens or assets if state variables are manipulated to bypass checks.

Additionally, any arithmetic errors that occur in the `Infiltration` CA would likely propagate through to the `InfiltrationPeriphery` when it calls into the `Infiltration`. This could happen if the `Infiltration` returns incorrect values or modifies its state in unintended ways due to the unchecked arithmetic.

## Code Snippet

This concern arises from functions within `Infiltration.sol` using `UnsafeMathUint256` for arithmetic operations. For example:

```solidity
cost += _costToHeal(agent.healCount);
```

> [Infiltration.sol#L952](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/Infiltration.sol#L952);

Where `_costToHeal` uses:

```solidity
cost = HEAL_BASE_COST * (2 ** healCount);
```

> [Infiltration.sol#L1525](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/Infiltration.sol#L1525);

Then the code calls `unsafeAdd(agentIdsCount)` within the `heal` function (and many others like `escape` and `escapeRewards`, which I will be omitting for brevity.):

```solidity
uint256 newHealingAgentIdsCount = currentHealingAgentIdsCount.unsafeAdd(agentIdsCount);
```

> [Infiltration.sol#L816](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/Infiltration.sol#L816);

And in `UnsafeMathUint256`:

```solidity
  function unsafeAdd(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
      unchecked {
          return a + b;
      }
  }

  function unsafeSubtract(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
      unchecked {
          return a - b;
      }
  }

  function unsafeMultiply(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
      unchecked {
          return a * b;
      }
  }

  function unsafeDivide(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
      unchecked {
          return a / b;
      }
  }
```

> [UnsafeMathUint256.sol#L5-L27](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/libraries/UnsafeMathUint256.sol#L5-L27).

## Tool used

Manual review.

## Recommendation

Replace all calls to `UnsafeMathUint256` with Solidity's native arithmetic operations that automatically check for overflows and underflows, or either completely limit the unsafe math usage to only owner restricted functions such as `startGame`. If there is a need to use unchecked arithmetic for gas optimization, it should only be done in cases where the inputs are controlled and cannot be manipulated by an attacker (which is not the case of the interested functions.), or where the results of the arithmetic operation do not affect the CA's critical state.

## PoC

1. Deploy the `Infiltration` CA on a mainnet fork.
2. Craft a tx that calls the `heal` function with carefully chosen parameters that will cause an overflow in the `healCount` for an agent. For instance, if `healCount` is close to the maximum value for `uint256`, the cost calculation could overflow.
3. Submit the tx and observe the CA's behavior. The cost should be significantly less than expected, or in the worst case even zero, due to the overflow.
4. Monitor the state changes in the CA to confirm that the overflow has led to an incorrect state update.

The specific values and method calls would need to be tailored to the deployed CA's state and the current block number, as these factors would affect the outcome of the random number generation and other aspects of the game logic.

As for an additional picture, and to better figure out the whole vulnerable concept behind `UnsafeMathUint256`, consider the following python illustration:

> ```python
> # Define the functions provided by UnsafeMathUint256 to test for overflows/underflows
> def unsafe_add(a, b):
>     # Simulate unchecked addition
>     return (a + b) & ((1 << 256) - 1)  # Simulate 256-bit overflow by wrapping around
> 
> def unsafe_subtract(a, b):
>     # Simulate unchecked subtraction, result should not be negative in uint256, so we check for underflow.
>     if a >= b:
>         return a - b
>     else:
>         # If b is greater than a, it would underflow, wrapping around in uint256 space
>         return ((1 << 256) + a) - b
> 
> def unsafe_multiply(a, b):
>     # Simulate unchecked multiplication
>     return (a * b) & ((1 << 256) - 1)  # Simulate 256-bit overflow by wrapping around
> 
> def unsafe_divide(a, b):
>     # Simulate unchecked division, assuming b is not zero as Solidity reverts on divide by zero
>     return a // b if b != 0 else 'Error: Division by zero'
>

Where the results of the arithmetic operation simulations using UnsafeMathUint256 with extreme values are:

> 1. Adding 1 to max_uint256 results in 0, which indicates an overflow as the value wraps around to zero, confirming that unchecked addition can lead to overflows (**addition overflow**).
> 2. Subtracting 1 from 0 results in max_uint256, which is a clear case of underflow since the operation wraps around when subtracting a larger number from a smaller one (**subtraction underflow**).
> 3. Multiplying max_uint256 by 2 results in max_uint256 - 1, showcasing another overflow scenario where the product exceeds the maximum representable value in a uint256 (**multiplication overflow**).
> 4. The function returns an error message for **division by zero** since solidity would revert this tx. Though in the simulation, it's handled by returning an error string instead of executing an operation that would cause a revert.

The above draft actually illustrates the mentioned concerns in the current impl of `Infiltration` in a proper manner and makes this finding worth the claimed impact.
