# Reentrancy Vulnerability in InfiltrationPeriphery Contract
## Summary

The InfiltrationPeriphery contract lacks a reentrancy guard which exposes the heal function to potential reentrancy attacks. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potentially loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the heal function, after the amountIn is calculated through SWAP_ROUTER.exactOutputSingle, funds are returned back to the contract through a call to SWAP_ROUTER.refundETH() and then forwarded to the sender via _transferETHAndWrapIfFailWithGasLimit. An external contract could have the ability to call the heal function again before these operations complete, leading to incorrect calculations and transfers of funds. The lack of a reentrancy guard allows for potential nested calls to the heal function, which is a classic example of a reentrancy vulnerability.

## Impact

If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to incorrect state, unexpected behavior, and potentially loss of funds. It could disrupt the normal functioning of the contract and could be used by an attacker to drain funds from the contract under certain conditions.

## Code Snippet
The vulnerability is located in the `heal` function of the `InfiltrationPeriphery` contract:
[Code location](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/CONTRACTS/InfiltrationPeriphery.sol#L30-L44)

```solidity
function heal(uint256[] calldata agentIds) external payable {
    uint256 costToHealInLOOKS = INFILTRATION.costToHeal(agentIds);
    IV3SwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams({
        tokenIn: WETH,
        tokenOut: LOOKS,
        fee: POOL_FEE,
        recipient: address(this),
        amountOut: costToHealInLOOKS,
        amountInMaximum: msg.value,
        sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
    });
    uint256 amountIn = SWAP_ROUTER.exactOutputSingle{value: msg.value}(params);
    IERC20(LOOKS).approve(address(TRANSFER_MANAGER), costToHealInLOOKS);
    INFILTRATION.heal(agentIds);
    if (msg.value > amountIn) {
        SWAP_ROUTER.refundETH();
        unchecked {
            _transferETHAndWrapIfFailWithGasLimit(WETH, msg.sender, msg.value - amountIn, gasleft());
        }
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a reentrancy guard to prevent nested calls to the heal function. One common approach is to use the nonReentrant modifier from the OpenZeppelin library which ensures that a function cannot be re-entered before the initial call has completed.
