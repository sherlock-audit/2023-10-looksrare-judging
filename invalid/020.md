# Malicious escape may lead to protocol funds loss or insolvency
## Summary

In the `Infiltration.sol` contract there is `escape()` function, which calculates `prizePool` in a `unchecked` block, which can lead to protocol funds loss or even insolvency in certain cases.

```solidity
            unchecked {
                prizePool = prizePool - rewardForPlayer - rewardToSecondaryPrizePool;
            }
```

## Vulnerability Detail

In case when there are two agents left, calling `escape()` function can lead to protocol funds loss or even insolvency, as `prizePool` can underflow in a scenario such as this:

There are 2 active agents left from 50 total agents.
The prize pool is 1 ETH.
The user decides to escape from the game using the `escape()` function using their `agentIds`. 
The `rewardForPlayer` is being calculated in this way: `(totalEscapeValue *_escapeMultiplier(currentRoundAgentsAlive)) /ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT_IN_BASIS_POINTS;` where function `_escapeMultiplier()` calculated this way:

```solidity
    function _escapeMultiplier(uint256 agentsRemaining) private view returns (uint256 multiplier) {
        multiplier =
            ((80 *
                ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT_IN_BASIS_POINTS_SQUARED -
                50 *
                (((agentsRemaining * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT_IN_BASIS_POINTS) / totalSupply()) ** 2)) * 100) /
            ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT_IN_BASIS_POINTS_SQUARED;
    }
```
Plugging in the numbers we get this equation which gets us the following number:
`((80*10**18 - 50 * (((2*10**8)/50)**2 * 100))/10**8 * (10**18 / 2))/10**8` which is equal to `3.996e+21`

Then this is used in `prizePool` calculation:

```solidity
                prizePool = prizePool - rewardForPlayer - rewardToSecondaryPrizePool;
```

## Impact
Doing the calculations above already the `RewardForPlayer` is bigger then the `prizePool` which leads to underflow and subsequently to an absurdly big number for the `prizePool` which the contract either can't redeem which will lead to insolvency or 
in the case the contract has enough funds that will lead to the theft of all of the funds from the contract and/or the winner not receiving his prize for the first place..

## Recommendation

Remove `unchecked` block  from `prizePool` calculations from the `escape()` function:

```diff
--            unchecked {
--                prizePool = prizePool - rewardForPlayer - rewardToSecondaryPrizePool;
--            }

++                prizePool = prizePool - rewardForPlayer - rewardToSecondaryPrizePool;
```
