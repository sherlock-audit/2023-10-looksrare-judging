# frontrunLock is initially locked, but there's no check that it gets unlocked after startGame() is called. An error could leave it locked forever.
## Summary
`frontrunLock` is initially locked, but there's no check that it gets unlocked after `startGame()` is called. An error could leave it locked forever. 
## Vulnerability Detail
There is a potential issue if frontrunLock gets stuck in the locked state after startGame() is called.
The frontrunLock variable controls whether agents can call the escape() and heal() functions. It is initially set to FRONTRUN_LOCK__LOCKED in the constructor:

       uint8 private frontrunLock = FRONTRUN_LOCK__LOCKED;

The `startGame()` function requests randomness from Chainlink VRF to start the first round, but does not explicitly unlock the frontrunLock:

       function startGame() external onlyOwner {

         // ...

         _requestForRandomness();

       }

The `frontrunLock` gets unlocked when the VRF fulfillment callback is triggered in `fulfillRandomWords()`:

       function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords) internal override {

         // ...

         frontrunLock = FRONTRUN_LOCK__UNLOCKED;

       }

The issue is that if the VRF request fails for some reason, the` fulfillRandomWords()` callback would never be called, and `frontrunLock` would remain locked forever.
This would prevent agents from ever being able to call `escape()` or `heal()`.

A detailed explanation: 
The `frontrunLock` is initialized to FRONTRUN_LOCK__LOCKED (value 2) in the constructor.
In `startGame()`, a VRF randomness request is made by calling `_requestForRandomness()`, which sets `frontrunLock` back to FRONTRUN_LOCK__LOCKED.
The `frontrunLock` gets unlocked again in `fulfillRandomWords()` when the VRF response is received by setting it to FRONTRUN_LOCK__UNLOCKED (value 1).
So the expected flow is:
1. `frontrunLock` starts locked
2. `startGame()` makes VRF request
3. `_requestForRandomness()` locks `frontrunLock`
4. `fulfillRandomWords()` unlocks `frontrunLock`
The consequence is that if `fulfillRandomWords()` fails to execute for some reason after `startGame()`, the frontrunLock remains locked forever, preventing any `escape()` or `heal()` calls.
This could happen for example if the fulfillRandomWords() runs out of gas due to a too low gas limit.


## Impact
Players would not be able to call the escape() or heal() functions. This would essentially break core gameplay functionality.
I would consider this a critical severity issue, as it would completely prevent players from escaping or healing their agents once the game has started. The `frontrunLock` is meant to mitigate frontrunning when requesting randomness, but it needs to be unlocked once the request is fulfilled so players can play the game.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A check could be added to startGame() to explicitly unlock frontrunLock after the VRF request:

       function startGame() external onlyOwner {

         // ...

         _requestForRandomness();

         frontrunLock = FRONTRUN_LOCK__UNLOCKED;

       }

This ensures that even if the VRF request fails, frontrunLock gets unlocked so the game can continue.
The contract owner could also call a new function to unlock frontrunLock in case it gets stuck.
