# Check in `fulfillRandomWords` is vulnerable in some specific situations
## Summary
There may be two vaild random numbers in the memory pool at the same time.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take a look at the logic in the fullRandomWords function to prevent expired random numbers: 

    if (randomnessRequestRoundId != currentRoundId || !randomnessRequest.exists) {
            emit InvalidRandomnessFulfillment(requestId, randomnessRequestRoundId, currentRoundId);
            return;
        }
 And the logic in `_requestForRandomness()`, where `randomnessRequests` is changed as below:

        randomnessRequests[requestId].exists = true;
        randomnessRequests[requestId].roundId = currentRoundId;
And RoundId would not increased until `fulfillRandomWords` is executed successfully, as `_incrementRound` is only triggered in `fulfillRandomWords`.
Consider the situation where the first VRF request is pending for more than 24 hours, `startNewRound` can be executed again, pushing another request into the mempool.
However, at this point, there are two different random numbers in the memory pool at the same time, both of them can be considered as valid, so it enables malicious people with MEV resource to choose a number on their preference.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make old `randomnessRequests[requestId]` expire when requesting for a new one.
