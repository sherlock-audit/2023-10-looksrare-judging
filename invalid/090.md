## Summary

[M-3] Return values of transfer()/transferFrom() not checked

## Vulnerability Detail

Not all IERC20 implementations revert() when there's a failure in transfer()/transferFrom(). The function signature has a boolean return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed may potentially go through without actually making a payment.

## Impact

The impact of not checking the return value of transfer()/transferFrom() is that operations that should have marked as failed may potentially go through without actually making a payment. This can lead to unintended financial transactions.

## Code Snippet

Instances (1):
- File: contracts/Infiltration.sol
  ```solidity
         super.transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);

  ```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to implement proper error handling and check the return values of transfer()/transferFrom() to ensure that payment operations are successful.
