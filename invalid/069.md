# looksrare Audit Report
## Summary
This report provides an audit of the LooksRare smart contract, including a review of its code, potential vulnerabilities, and recommendations for improving its security. LooksRare is a community-first NFT marketplace boosting over $1.3billion in rewards.
The audit was carried out for two smart contracts in scope 
Infiltration.sol and InfiltrationPeriphery.sol.
In carrying out this audit to evaluate the risk we employed the use of 
analysis and static analysis tool such as slither to identify issues and there inherent severities. Issues are further escalated by deploying smart contracts on testnet to determine if a PoC can be use to demonstrate the possibilities of an exploit. 
Furthermore, we performed the audit following procedures such as
Analysing the code for Basic Coding Bugs, manually verifying and looking out for code bugs.
Assessing the business logics, with the intended functionalities as explained in docs of the smart contract.
We engage in iterative reviews of the business logic against whilst examining the system operations, and
place DeFi-related aspects under scrutiny to uncover possible pitfalls and/or bugs.
We also provide additional recommendation as necessary 
for the improvement of the code base.
## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the summary of our findings after analysing the looksRare smart contracts;

1: Future Issues

Return Value from function Ignored May Cause Unexpected Behaviour

Description

In the heal function of the InfiltrationPeriphery contract, IERC20 interface's approve function which returns a bool. The IERC20.approve was called without making use of the return value, it not guaranteed to execute successfully in every instance which could lead to unreliable contract behaviour. Although it does not lead to a grave potential security danger, functional integrity is an issue.

## Impact
These vulnerabilities poses a medium risk to the "looksRare" smart contract. It could lead to unexpected behaviour in the smart contract when return always assumed true actually returns false. This affects health contract functionality.

}

## Tool used
slither
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, implement making use of the return value from the IERC20.approve function for further computation.
Suggestion
''''
bool success = IERC20(LOOKS).approve(address(TRANSFER_MANAGER), costToHealInLOOKS);

if(success).....
