# function `heal` is broken due to invalid approval
## Summary
Users are unable to use the `heal` function in InfiltrationPeripheral.sol normally.

## Vulnerability Detail
In function `heal`, user's $ETH is exchanged for $LOOKS in uniswap v3, and the codes below would be executed:

    IERC20(LOOKS).approve(address(TRANSFER_MANAGER), costToHealInLOOKS);
    INFILTRATION.heal(agentIds);
It is worth noting that, instead of approve for `Infiltration`, it approves for `TRANSFER_MANAGER`.
However, when it tries to call `INFILTRATION.heal(agentIds)`, the logic used to transfer tokens is

    TRANSFER_MANAGER.transferERC20(LOOKS, msg.sender, address(this), cost);
In [TRANSFER_MANAGER.transferERC20](https://github.com/LooksRare/contracts-transfer-manager/blob/29b789149fb798c10445c0bed52e2ad3aa4d3fb7/contracts/TransferManager.sol#L54), `_executeERC20TransferFrom` in [LowLevelERC20Transfer.sol](https://github.com/LooksRare/contracts-libs/blob/master/contracts/lowLevelCallers/LowLevelERC20Transfer.sol) is called:

    // Excerpt from TransferManager.sol
    function transferERC20(
        address tokenAddress,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external {
        _isOperatorValidForTransfer(from, msg.sender);

        if (amount == 0) {
            revert AmountInvalid();
        }

        _executeERC20TransferFrom(tokenAddress, from, to, amount);
    }
    
    // Excerpt from LowLevelERC20Transfer.sol
    function _executeERC20TransferFrom(address currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (currency.code.length == 0) {
            revert NotAContract();
        }

        (bool status, bytes memory data) = currency.call(abi.encodeCall(IERC20.transferFrom, (from, to, amount)));

        if (!status) {
            revert ERC20TransferFromFail();
        }

        if (data.length > 0) {
            if (!abi.decode(data, (bool))) {
                revert ERC20TransferFromFail();
            }
        }
    }

As shown in the code above, the approval of $LOOKS should be given to Infiltration contract instead of transer manager.
## Impact
function `heal` is broken.

## Recommendation
Use `IERC20(LOOKS).approve(address(Infiltration), costToHealInLOOKS);`instead of `IERC20(LOOKS).approve(address(TRANSFER_MANAGER), costToHealInLOOKS);`
