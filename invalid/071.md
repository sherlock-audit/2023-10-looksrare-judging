# `Transferfrom` is not protected by frontrun lock
## Summary
`Transferfrom` is not well protected, make front running attacks profitable.

## Vulnerability Detail
Malicious users can detect random numbers sent by VRFCoordinatorV2 to this contract when they are in the mempool, and use the algorithm in the contract to calculate whether they will be wounded in this turn, making it possible for frontrun attack.

As described in the official document of [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security#dont-accept-bidsbetsinputs-after-you-have-made-a-randomness-request), the contract should 
>  Don't accept bids/bets/inputs after you have made a randomness request

## Impact
People may bid for active agents on trading platforms, Malicious users can frontrun the random number and sell their agent when frontrun lock is on, which make bidders to purchase wounded agents at the price of purchasing active agents. This should be prohibited because it grants privileges to users with MEV resources.

## Code Snippet

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public payable override {
            AgentStatus status = agents[agentIndex(tokenId)].status;
            if (status > AgentStatus.Wounded) {
                revert InvalidAgentStatus(tokenId, status);
            }
            super.transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);
    }

## Tool used

## Recommendation
Add `_assertFrontrunLockIsOff` for `Transferfrom`. This will not significantly increase the gas used for transaction, and the time spent waiting for a response from ChainLink accounts for a relatively small proportion of the round time, so it won't affect the vast majority of transactions either.
