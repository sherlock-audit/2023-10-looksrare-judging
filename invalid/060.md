# Because of missing slippage parameter, mint() can be front-runned
## Summary

Missing slippage parameter in mint() makes it vulnerable to front-run attacks and exposes users to unwanted slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation of the mint() function lacks a parameter for controlling slippage, which makes it vulnerable to front-run attacks. Transactions involving large volumes are particularly at risk, as the minting process can be manipulated, resulting in price impact. This manipulation allows the reserves of the pool to be controlled, enabling a frontrunner to make the transferred token to appear more valuable than its actual worth.
