# `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS` invariant can be broke
## Summary

The `premint` function in the Infiltration.sol contract lacks necessary checks for `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS`, potentially violating the minting limitations established for fair gameplay. Additionally, the function can be invoked at any time before the game starts, which is inconsistent with the intended functionality as documented.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `premint` function does not enforce the `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS` limit which exists in the regular `mint` function. This oversight allows for an unlimited amount of tokens to be preminted for an address, which can break the game's fairness as the invariant of `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS` is not respected. Furthermore, the function lacks a timestamp check to ensure it is called only after the minting period ends, thus allowing premature execution that can disrupt the game start.

## Impact

If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to an unfair advantage for certain players who could bypass the minting limitations, undermining the integrity of the game's economy and the trust of the player base. This may also have financial repercussions if the game involves trading or value associated with the minted items.

    uint256 amountMinted = amountMintedPerAddress[msg.sender] + quantity;
    if (amountMinted > MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS) {
        revert TooManyMinted();
    }

    if (quantity * PRICE != msg.value) {
        revert InsufficientNativeTokensSupplied();
    }

    if (totalSupply() + quantity > MAX_SUPPLY) {
        revert ExceededTotalSupply();
    }

    amountMintedPerAddress[msg.sender] = amountMinted;
    _mintERC2309(msg.sender, quantity);
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add a check within the `premint` function to enforce the `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS` limit. This check should mimic the one present in the `mint` function to maintain consistency and ensure fairness. Moreover, a timestamp condition should be introduced to confirm that `premint` can only be called after `mintEnd`. Implementing these checks will align the function's behavior with its intended use as specified in the documentation.
