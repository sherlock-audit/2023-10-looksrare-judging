# In setMintPeriod there is no check if the game has began, and can change the end mint period
## Summary
There is no check if block.timestamp is greater than the previous mintEnd in setMintPeriod
## Vulnerability Detail
When the owner wants to change the end Period he must set later date than the previous, but there is no check if the game has began and the gameInfo.currenRound is greater 0. This way if the owner change the mintPeriod when the game has began, anyone can mint new agents before the block.timestamp is greater than the newMintEnd
## Impact
Anyone can mint when the game has begun which leads to miscalculation in the prize and there should be anyone that can join in the middle of the game!

## Recommendation
Check if the gameInfo.currenRound is different from 0 ->
if(gameInfo.currentRoundId != 0){
revert GameAlreadyBegun();
