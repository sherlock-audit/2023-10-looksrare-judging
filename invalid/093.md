## Summary

Contracts are vulnerable to fee-on-transfer accounting-related issues

## Vulnerability Detail

Certain functions in the smart contract are designed to transfer funds from the caller to the receiver using the `transferFrom()` function. However, a critical issue arises in these functions: they do not ensure that the actual number of tokens received is the same as the input amount to the transfer.

In the context of fee-on-transfer tokens, which deduct a fee during each transfer, this vulnerability becomes especially problematic. When tokens with transfer fees are involved, the balance after the transfer may be smaller than expected, resulting in accounting issues. This can potentially lead to discrepancies in the contract's internal accounting, rendering it vulnerable to exploitation.

The concern goes beyond accounting issues. In scenarios where there are checks later, associated with a secondary transfer, an attacker could exploit latent funds, which may have been mistakenly sent by another user, to gain a free credit. To address this issue, it is advisable to measure the balance both before and after the transfer and use the difference as the actual transferred amount, rather than relying solely on the stated amount.

## Impact

The impact of contracts vulnerable to fee-on-transfer accounting-related issues is multifaceted. It includes:

- Accounting discrepancies, which can affect the internal state of the contract.
- Potential exploitation by attackers who can use latent funds to gain unearned credits.
- Risks to the accuracy of financial transactions and associated operations within the contract.

These consequences can lead to financial losses, security vulnerabilities, and issues related to the contract's financial integrity.

## Recommendation

To mitigate the vulnerability associated with fee-on-transfer accounting issues, it is strongly recommended to revise the affected functions in the contract. One way to address this issue is to measure the token balance both before and after the transfer and utilize the difference as the actual transferred amount. Implementing this practice enhances the accuracy of financial transactions, reduces the risk of latent fund exploitation, and ensures the integrity of the contract's financial accounting.
