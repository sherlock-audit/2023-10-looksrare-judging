# Lack Of Ownership Verification in 'transferFrom' Function
## Summary
The` transferFrom` function lacks proper ownership verification, allowing unauthorized transfers of agents. Specifically, it does not check if the from address is the owner of the `tokenId` being transferred.
## Vulnerability Detail
 The `transferFrom` function is intended to facilitate the transfer of agents between addresses. However, it lacks a crucial ownership verification step, which means that any address can potentially transfer any agent, regardless of ownership.
## Impact
The issue lies in the fact that there is no check to ensure that the from address is the legitimate owner of the agent represented by `tokenId`. This lack of ownership verification opens up the possibility for unauthorized transfers, potentially leading to another user transferring agents from a `tokenId` that ain't theirs.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this bug and ensure proper access control and ownership verification, the `transferFrom` function should be modified to include a check for owner is equal to the from address as shown below.

`function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public payable override {
    address owner = ownerOf(tokenId);  // Get the current owner of the agent.
    require(owner == from, "You are not the owner of this agent.");`
