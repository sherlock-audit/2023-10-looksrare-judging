# Using `transferFrrom()` instead of `safeTransferFrom()`
## Summary
The `transferFrom()` function is used instead of `safeTransferFrom()` presumably to save gas. I however argue that this is not recommended since there is no restriction if the receiver is a contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `transferFrom()` function does not implement a check if the receiver address is a contract and does not check the return value, so there is no way to check if the NFT has been received successfully.

## Impact
If the receiver contract does not implement `onERC721Received()`, it means that the contract does not have a way to handle incoming ERC721 tokens safely. This could lead to problems with using the received tokens after that.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `safeTransferFrom()` function. It checks if the receiver is a contract and, if it is, tries to execute the `onERC721Received()` function on the receiver. If the receiver contract does not implement `onERC721Received()`, the `safeTransferFrom()` function will fail.
