# maximumAmountMintedPerAddress can be bypassed by anyone
## Summary
`maximumAmountMintedPerAddress` being bypassed by the owner is an acceptable risk as documented. However, it can actually be bypassed by anyone.

## Vulnerability Detail
Each address can only mint up to `maximumAmountMintedPerAddress`. However, users can use `transferFrom` from another address to transfer to itself, hence allowing a single address to go over the mint limit even if it is not the owner. `transferFrom` does not check that the `to` address is below the `maximumAmountMintedPerAddress`.

## Impact
Any users can bypass `maximumAmountMintedPerAddress`, even if it is not the owner.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `transferFrom`, check that `to` address is below the limit after the transfer.
