# [H-01]Re-requesting randomness from VRF is a security anti-pattern
## Summary
Re-requesting randomness from VRF is a security anti-pattern as mentioned in the Vrf [docs](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security#do-not-re-request-randomness)

Likelihood: High, as there is an incentive for a VRF provider to exploit this and it is not hard to do from his side



## Vulnerability Detail

The `StartNewRound` function allows re requesting the randomness from the VRF provider, however this goes against the security standards in using VRF, as stated in the [docs](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security#do-not-re-request-randomness):
`
Any re-request of randomness is an incorrect use of VRFv2. Doing so would give the VRF service provider the option to withhold a VRF fulfillment if the outcome is not favorable to them and wait for the re-request in the hopes that they get a better outcome, similar to the considerations with block confirmation time.
Re-requesting randomness is easily detectable on-chain and should be avoided for use cases that want to be considered as using VRFv2 correctly.
`



## Impact
 High, as the VRF service provider has control over the random value that provides the best stats for `heal` and `damage`, highly impacting the final outcome. 
When the `startNewRound` is invoked, the attacker/service provider could monitor the transaction mempool, then frontrun the `_requestForRandomness();` 
The  Fairness of the protocol is tapered with.

    function startNewRound() external nonReentrant {
    //
    //
    //
_requestForRandomness();
}
