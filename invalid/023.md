# Missing mint caps
## Summary

The `Infiltration.sol` contract inherits from `ERC721A`.
`ERC721A` has a quantity limit of 5000:
```solidity
uint256 private constant _MAX_MINT_ERC2309_QUANTITY_LIMIT = 5000;
```

https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A/blob/main/contracts/ERC721A.sol

on `_mintERC2309()` function. 
Currently, there is no check for `quantity` parameter in `premint()` and `mint()` functions of our contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Our contract inherits from `ERC721A` which packs `balance`, `numberMinted`, `numberBurned`, and
an extra data chunk in 1 storage slot (64 bits per substorage) for every address. This would add an inherent
cap of `2^64-1` to all these different fields. Currently, there is no check for quantity.

Also, if we almost reach the max cap for a balance by an owner and someone else transfers a token to this owner,
there would be an overflow for the balance and possibly the number of mints in the `_packedAddressData`:

## Impact

The overflow could reduce the `balance` and the `numberMinted` to a way lower number and `numberBurned` to a
way higher number.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add an additional check if `quantity` would exceed the mint cap before calling `_mintERC2309`.
