# fulfillRandomWords must not revert
## Summary
According to chainlink VRF security:

> If your fulfillRandomWords() implementation reverts, the VRF service will not attempt to call it a second time. Make sure your contract logic does not revert

## Vulnerability Detail
When VRF service invoke `fulfillRandomWords` , if current healingAgents is bigger than 0 then protocol call `_healRequestFulfilled` to heal to kill agent
```solidity
        if (healingAgents != 0) {
            uint256 healedAgents;
            (healedAgents, deadAgentsFromHealing, currentRandomWord) = _healRequestFulfilled(
                currentRoundId,
                currentRoundAgentsAlive,
                currentRandomWord
            ); <---------------------------------------------- invoke here
            unchecked {
                currentRoundAgentsAlive -= deadAgentsFromHealing;
                activeAgents += healedAgents;
                gameInfo.healingAgents = uint16(healingAgents - healedAgents - deadAgentsFromHealing);
            }
        }
```
If agent is successfully healed 25% of the $LOOKS paid as healing fees are burned 
Those burned token are send to target address via blow function \

```solidity
        _executeERC20DirectTransfer(
            LOOKS,
            0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD,
            _costToHeal(lastHealCount) / 4
        );
```

Then let's dive into above function 

```solidity
    function _executeERC20DirectTransfer(address currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (currency.code.length == 0) {
            revert NotAContract();
        }

        (bool status, bytes memory data) = currency.call(abi.encodeCall(IERC20.transfer, (to, amount)));

        if (!status) {
            revert ERC20TransferFail();
        }

        if (data.length > 0) {
            if (!abi.decode(data, (bool))) {
                revert ERC20TransferFail();
            }
        }
    }
```
As we can see  above function can potentially revert due to certain reasons. Once revert happen the VRF service will not attempt to call it a second time  and the game will no longer continue.


## Impact
If `fulfillRandomWords` the VRF server will not attempt to call it a second time

```solidity
        _executeERC20DirectTransfer(
            LOOKS,
            0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD,
            _costToHeal(lastHealCount) / 4
        );
```

```solidity
    function _executeERC20DirectTransfer(address currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (currency.code.length == 0) {
            revert NotAContract();
        }

        (bool status, bytes memory data) = currency.call(abi.encodeCall(IERC20.transfer, (to, amount)));

        if (!status) {
            revert ERC20TransferFail();
        }

        if (data.length > 0) {
            if (!abi.decode(data, (bool))) {
                revert ERC20TransferFail();
            }
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation
Consider simply storing the randomness and taking more complex follow-on actions in separate contract calls made by you
