## Summary

[M-4] Unsafe use of transfer()/transferFrom() with IERC20

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example, Tether (USDT)'s transfer() and transferFrom() functions on L1 do not return booleans as the specification requires and instead have no return value. When these sorts of tokens are cast to IERC20, their function signatures do not match, and therefore the calls made, revert. Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20's safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom() instead.

## Impact

The impact of using transfer()/transferFrom() with tokens that do not implement the ERC20 standard properly is that the calls may revert, leading to potential disruptions and errors in the code's functionality.

## Code Snippet

Instances (1):

```solidity
File: contracts/Infiltration.sol

929:         super.transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20's safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom() when dealing with tokens that do not implement the ERC20 standard properly to prevent potential reverts and disruptions.
