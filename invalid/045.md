# A game can be started with just one player, which should be an invalid game
## Summary
The game can start with just one agent as long as the mint end time has passed.
This is possible because there's no restriction set on the minimum number of agents to start a valid game.

## Vulnerability Detail
The purpose of the game is to get a random word to decide the fate of the agents and reducing the number of active agents either by killing or wounding agents until only one agent survives.
However, if only one agent is minted, and the the mint end time has passed. If the game is started, it will result in the sole agent being the winner.

## Impact
This results in an invalid game where the sole agent takes the winnings. 

## Code Snippet
```POC
    function test_startGame_RevertIf_GameAlreadyBegun_1() public {
        vm.warp(_mintStart());

        uint160 startingUser = 11;

        for (uint160 i = startingUser; i < 1 + startingUser; i++) {
            vm.deal(address(i), PRICE * 1);
            vm.prank(address(i));
            infiltration.mint{value: PRICE * 1}({quantity: 1});
        }
        vm.prank(owner);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp+ 1 days);
   

        infiltration.startGame();

    }
    ```
## Tool used
Foundry

## Recommendation
 Set a minimum threshold for the number of players and ensuring that it is surpassed before starting the game.
