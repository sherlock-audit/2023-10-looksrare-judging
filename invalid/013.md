# Algorithm error
Summary
Inconsistency in calculations related to the HEAL_PROBABILITY_MINUEND parameter

Vulnerability Detail
Inconsistency between the parameters used in the initialization HEAL_PROBABILITY_MINUEND and subsequent calculations in the healProbability function.
The algorithm for calculating HEAL_PROBABILITY_MINUEND is *99-80. the calculation in HEALProbability is *19 (which is 99-80) .

Impact
The result of the healProbability function calculation is large, affecting the token destruction in _healRequestFulfilled, and the return value deadAgentsCount is not increased. The end of the game was delayed.

Recommendation
It is recommended to modify the HEAL_PROBABILITY_MINUEND parameter or the calculation in the healProbability function.
