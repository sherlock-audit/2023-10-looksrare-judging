# Inefficiency and Potential Gas Overhead Due to Forced ETH Transfer Failures
## Summary
Forced ETH transfer failure could cause unnecessary gas expenditure during protocol fee processing.

## Vulnerability Detail
The _transferETHAndWrapIfFailWithGasLimit function aims to ensure successful ETH transfers to a specified recipient. If an ETH transfer fails, it automatically converts the ETH to WETH and transfers that instead. An issue arises when a recipient is a smart contract intentionally designed without a payable fallback or receive function, causing the ETH transfer to fail. The transaction then defaults to converting ETH to WETH and transferring WETH, which requires more gas due to additional steps and contract interactions. This can be exploited, resulting in higher gas costs.

## Impact
- Increased Gas Costs: Unnecessary expenditure of gas if the initial transfer fails, which could be especially significant for large transfers or if such transfers are frequent.

- Operational Disruption: If actors repeatedly force the fallback mechanism, it could lead to operational inefficiencies and potentially disrupt the intended flow of funds.

- User Experience Degradation: End users may experience increased transaction costs and longer wait times due to the more complex fallback process being triggered.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement safeguards to prevent the initial ETH transfer from failing due to recipient contract behavior. This may include checking if the recipient is a contract and whether it can accept ETH, or setting a reasonable gas limit for the transfer. Additionally, consider a pattern that does not rely solely on the gasleft() function, which could be manipulated by the preceding code in the transaction.
