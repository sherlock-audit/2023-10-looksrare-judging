# Unsafe downcast
## Summary
When a type is downcast to a smaller type, the higher order bits are truncated

## Vulnerability Detail
When a type is downcast to a smaller type, the higher order bits are truncated, effectively applying a modulo to the original value. Without any other checks, this wrapping will lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

Solidity does not check if it is safe to cast an integer to a smaller one. Unless some business logic ensures that the downcasting is safe, a library like SafeCast should be used.


## Impact
When a type is downcast to a smaller type, the higher order bits are truncated, effectively applying a modulo to the original value. Without any other checks, this wrapping will lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/Infiltration.sol?plain=1#L875
```solidity
                healingAgentIds[currentHealingAgentIdsCount + i] = uint16(agentId);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/Infiltration.sol?plain=1#L879
```solidity
        healingAgentIds[0] = uint16(newHealingAgentIdsCount);
```

```solidity
        gameInfo.activeAgents = uint16(numberOfAgents);
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can use the [SafeCast](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol) library to prevent Unsafe downcast.
