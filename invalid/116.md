# Reentrancy vulnerability in `escapeReward`
## Summary

The `escapeReward` function in the `Infiltration.sol` contract may be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as it lacks the `nonReentrant` modifier which is present in the `escape` function. This inconsistency in the use of reentrancy protection mechanisms could potentially be exploited by an attacker.

## Vulnerability Detail

Reentrancy is a common vulnerability in smart contracts where a function makes an external call to an untrusted contract, and that call is used to re-enter the original function before its execution is completed. The `escape` function is protected by the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent such attacks, however, the `escapeReward` function does not include this modifier. If the `escapeReward` function interacts with external contracts or sends Ether to arbitrary addresses, it could be susceptible to reentrancy.

## Impact

If this vulnerability is exploited, an attacker could drain funds or cause unintended effects by recursively calling the `escapeReward` function. This could lead to a loss of funds or tokens, degradation of trust in the contract's security, and potential destabilization of the contract's economic mechanisms.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to apply the `nonReentrant` modifier to the `escapeReward` function to prevent potential reentrancy attacks. In addition to this, a thorough audit and testing of the function's interactions with external contracts should be conducted to ensure all potential reentrancy paths are mitigated.

To further enhance security, consider following the checks-effects-interactions pattern, ensuring that no state changes happen after external calls and that all the effects are handled prior to calling external contracts or addresses.
