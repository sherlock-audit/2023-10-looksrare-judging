# The secondaryPrizePoolShareBp function can return share amounts over 100% for certain inputs.
## Summary
The share formula has the potential for manipulation due to lack of input validation, allowing share percentages over 100%. This can be fixed by capping the maximum share percentage
## Vulnerability Detail
The secondaryPrizePoolShareBp function can return share amounts over 100% for certain inputs.
The vulnerable code is:

       function secondaryPrizePoolShareBp(uint256 placement) public pure returns (uint256 share) {
         share = (1_31817 * (995_000_000 / (placement * 49) - uint256(15_000_000) / 49)) / 1_000_000_000; 
       }

This calculates the share percentage for a given placement.

The vulnerability is that for small values of placement, the 995_000_000 / (placement * 49) term can be very large, resulting in share being over 100%.

For example, if placement is 1, then share is calculated as:

       share = (1_31817 * (995_000_000 / (1 * 49) - 15_000_000 / 49)) / 1_000_000_000  
            = 1_31817 * (20,306,122 - 306,122) / 1_000_000 
            = 131.817%

This allows the share percentage for 1st place to be over 100%, effectively draining the secondary prize pool.

## Impact
It could enable manipulating the share amounts in an unfair way. Specifically:
• By setting a low placement value, a user could claim more than their fair share of the secondary prize pool. For example, if someone claims the #1 spot, they could get over 100% of the pool.
• This could leave less for legitimate winners with higher placements. For shares over 100%, each extra percent claimed reduces what others get.
The severity seems high since it undermines the fairness of the prize distribution. Allowing invalid inputs leading to incorrect outputs suggests a critical logic flaw.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We need to cap the maximum share percentage at 100%:

       function secondaryPrizePoolShareBp(uint256 placement) public pure returns (uint256 share) {

         uint256 calculatedShare = (1_31817 * (995_000_000 / (placement * 49) - uint256(15_000_000) / 49)) / 1_000_000_000;

         if (calculatedShare > 100_000) { // 100% in basis points
           return 100_000; 
         }

         return calculatedShare;

       }

This caps the maximum share percentage at 100, preventing manipulation of the share amounts.
