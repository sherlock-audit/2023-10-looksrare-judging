# Sync between GameInfo and agents list
## Summary
There is a possibility that gameInfo active agents data is out of sync with the agents array length. In the `claimGrandPrize` and `claimSecondaryPrizes` the `_assertGameOver` function is called which checks the number of active agents with `gameInfo.activeAgents`. ActiveAgents is updated when function fulfillRandomWords is called during startGame or startNewRound which can be called once a day.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Vulnerability comes in when a game is started and ended but grandPrize becomes unclaimable because out gameInfo is out of sync with agents list due to the fact that every time that an agent is healed successfully the `_healRequestFulfilled` does not update update the gameInfo.activeAgent is not updated but agents list is swapped, so the data of the agent becomes out of sync with the gameInfo.

## Impact
This impacts the contract with mixed accounting keeping the game for longer and incorrectly choosing the winner after multiple calls to `_swaps` have been made either by the dead agent from being healed or healed agent

## Code Snippet

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < healingAgentIdsCount; ) {
                uint256 healingAgentId = healingAgentIds[i.unsafeAdd(1)];
                uint256 index = agentIndex(healingAgentId);
                Agent storage agent = agents[index];

                healResults[i].agentId = healingAgentId;

                // 1. An agent's "healing at" round ID is always equal to the current round ID
                //    as it immediately settles upon randomness fulfillment.
                //
                // 2. 10_000_000_000 == 100 * PROBABILITY_PRECISION
                if (randomWord % 10_000_000_000 <= healProbability(roundId.unsafeSubtract(agent.woundedAt))) {
                    // This line is not needed as HealOutcome.Healed is 0. It is here for clarity.
                    // healResults[i].outcome = HealOutcome.Healed;
                    uint256 lastHealCount = _healAgent(agent);
                    _executeERC20DirectTransfer(
                        LOOKS,
                        0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD,
                        _costToHeal(lastHealCount) / 4
                    );
                } else {
                    healResults[i].outcome = HealOutcome.Killed;
                    _swap({
                        currentAgentIndex: index,
                        lastAgentIndex: currentRoundAgentsAlive - deadAgentsCount,
                        agentId: healingAgentId,
                        newStatus: AgentStatus.Dead
                    });
                    unchecked {
                        ++deadAgentsCount;
                    }
                }

                randomWord = _nextRandomWord(randomWord);

                unchecked {
                    ++i;
                }
            }

            unchecked {
                healedAgentsCount = healingAgentIdsCount - deadAgentsCount;
            }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add an update for gameInfo.activeAgents if agent is healed or dead for the functions  `_woundRequestFulfilled` and `_healRequestFulfilled`
