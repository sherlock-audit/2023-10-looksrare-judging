# Suspicious `premint` function not specified in Audit context
medium

## Summary
There is a `premint` function that allows owner to skip mint period check and mint before the game starts. In some cases this is fine but the context Q&A mentioned that owner can only perform 3 actions, and this is not one of them.

## Vulnerability Detail
The context Q&A clearly stated that owner can only perform 3 actions:
```javascript
// The only role is the owner and it can do 3 things

// 1. set/extend mint period
// 2. start the game after mint
// 3. withdraw funds from the contract if the game is bricked
```

It is also not mentioned anywhere in the project's README.md

The `premint` function allows owner to bypass mint period check and mint the NFTs directly, which is not one of the actions that owner should be able to perform according to context Q&A.

```solidity
    /**
     * @inheritdoc IInfiltration
     * @notice As long as the game has not started (after mint end), the owner can still mint.
     */
    function premint(address to, uint256 quantity) external payable onlyOwner {
        if (quantity * PRICE != msg.value) {
            revert InsufficientNativeTokensSupplied();
        }

        if (totalSupply() + quantity > MAX_SUPPLY) {
            revert ExceededTotalSupply();
        }

        if (gameInfo.currentRoundId != 0) {
            revert GameAlreadyBegun();
        }

        _mintERC2309(to, quantity);
    }

```

## Impact
Owner role can bypass the rules and mint NFTs before anyone can, which is not one of the actions that owner should be able to perform according to context Q&A.
