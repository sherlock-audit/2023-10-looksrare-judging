# The calculation in the secondaryPrizePoolShareBp() function suffers from precision loss
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
This code snippet suffers from potential precision loss due to integer division. The issue arises from the use of integer division in the calculations, which can lead to the truncation of decimal places.
```solidity
  function secondaryPrizePoolShareBp(uint256 placement) public pure returns (uint256 share) {
        share = (1_31817 * (995_000_000 / (placement * 49) - uint256(15_000_000) / 49)) / 1_000_000_000;
    }

```

 To mitigate this precision loss, it is advisable to refactor the code by performing the multiplication with the constant factor before the division. Specifically, the calculation should be adjusted as follows:
```solidity
(1_31817 * (995_000_000 - 1_31817 * uint256(15_000_000)) / (placement * 49)) / 1_000_000_000

```

## Impact
This leads to inaccuracies in the calculation of the share.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The suggested modification for the calculation is as follows:
```solidity
(1_31817 * (995_000_000 - 1_31817 * uint256(15_000_000)) / (placement * 49)) / 1_000_000_000

```
