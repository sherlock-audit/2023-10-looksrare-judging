# Usage of transferFrom() instead of safeTransferFrom()
## Summary
In the `transferFrom()` function it is used `transferFrom()` (from ERC721) which is not a safe way for transferring the tokens as tthe ERC721 standard might not be supported by the receiver.

## Vulnerability Detail
See summary.

## Impact
Utilizing the `transferFrom()` function to transfer tokens poses a significant risk in scenarios where `msg.sender` is a smart contract that is not compatible with the ERC721 standard.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `safeTransferFrom()` instead of `transferFrom()` when you want to ensure that the tokens are not accidentally sent to a contract that is not designed to handle them.
