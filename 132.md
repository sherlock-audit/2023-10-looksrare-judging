# Possible blocking of the game
## Summary
Possible blocking of the game

## Vulnerability Detail
When the owner decides to start the game, he calls the `startGame()` function and request random word from the VRF Coordinator. If the Chainlink randomness callback does not return after 1 day, the owner can call `startNewRound()` to trigger a new randomness request.

```solidity
 /**
     * @inheritdoc IInfiltration
     * @dev If Chainlink randomness callback does not come back after 1 day, we can call
     *      startNewRound to trigger a new randomness request.
     */
    function startGame() external onlyOwner 
```

Unfortunately, this is not possible because to call a new round, the condition `block.number < uint256(gameInfo.currentRoundBlockNumber).unsafeAdd(BLOCKS_PER_ROUND)` should be satisfied.

```solidity
if (block.number < uint256(gameInfo.currentRoundBlockNumber).unsafeAdd(BLOCKS_PER_ROUND)) {
            revert TooEarlyToStartNewRound();
 }
```

Variable `gameInfo.currentRoundBlockNumber` is set to 0 by default and is updated only in `fulfillRandomWords()`. In this scenario, it will always be zero because the Chainlink randomness callback is delayed.

So, if the Chainlink randomness callback is delayed for more than 1 day and the owner tries to request a random word, it will fail.

## Impact
In this scenario, the whole game will be blocked and it will not be possible to start. Marked this issue as Medium because it is rare for Chainlink randomness callback to have this delay, but it is not impossible.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update `gameInfo.currentRoundBlockNumber` when `startGame()` function is called:


```diff
gameInfo.currentRoundId = 1;
gameInfo.activeAgents = uint16(numberOfAgents);
+gameInfo.currentRoundBlockNumber = block.number
uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
```
