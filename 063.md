# Infiltration::setMintPeriod() - Here `block.timestamp` should never be `== newMintEnd`, i.e. case `<= newMintEnd` is incorrect logic, should be `< newMintEnd`.
## Summary

Just a logic error case of using `>` (implying `<=`) when should be using `>=` (implying `<`) as valid case.

## Vulnerability Detail

Follow the logic:

Means valid logic is: `newMintStart < newMintEnd`:
```solidity
        if (newMintStart >= newMintEnd) {
            revert InvalidMintPeriod();
        }
```
Means valid logic is: `block.timestamp <= newMintStart`:
```solidity
        if (newMintStart != 0) {
            if (block.timestamp > newMintStart) {
                revert MintStartIsInThePast();
            }
```
Bad logic is: `block.timestamp <= newMintEnd`, and the valid logic should be: `block.timestamp < newMintEnd`:
```solidity
        if (block.timestamp > newMintEnd || newMintEnd < mintEnd) {
            revert MintCanOnlyBeExtended();
        }
```

## Impact

Low, as nothing bad is possible to happen, because the first two `if` blocks' reverts will prevent this scenario where `block.timestamp == newMintEnd`, but still the logic of the implementation should be fixed.

So this cannot be a medium severity, unless judges disagree, it should be QA or low, but it's important for sponsor to fix this, regardless.

## Recommendation

To fix the logic, meaning that `block.timestamp < newMintEnd` is valid, we need to change the below from `>` to `>=`:
```diff
-       if (block.timestamp > newMintEnd || newMintEnd < mintEnd) { /// @audit means `<=` which is invalid for case `==`
+       if (block.timestamp >= newMintEnd || newMintEnd < mintEnd) { /// @audit means `<` which is valid
            revert MintCanOnlyBeExtended();
        }
```
