# Minting can be easily sybilled by calling from multiple addresses
## Summary
During the public mint phase, the Infiltration contract enforces that one address should not be able to mint more than `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS` tokens. However it is easy to circumvent this limitation by creating multiple contracts calling the mint function in one single transaction and mint an arbitrary amount of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

We can see in the public mint function, that a limitation is enforced for the `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS`:

However a malicious participant Alice could set up a contract to call the mint function from different child contracts. This would allow Alice to gain a significant advantage over other participants, since as one can see in the other issues reported:

- Weak randomness in _woundRequestFulfilled can be slightly manipulated
- A participant with enough active agents can force win for his wounded agents
- A participant with enough agents can force win while some opponents' agents are healing

Having more agents can be used to influence the game outcome especially in the later stages.

## Impact
A participant can buy an arbitrarily large amount of tokens and influence the game outcome

## Recommendation
Please consider set up a whitelisted minting
