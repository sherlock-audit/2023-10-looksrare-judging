# `agents[1].agentId` access in `claimGrandPrize` is potentially incorrect and can lead to loss of grand prize
## Summary

`agents[1].agentId` can potentially be `0` in the event that `agentId = 1` is the winner. This will cause problems with claiming the grand prize.  

## Vulnerability Detail

Initially, for all `i`, `agents[i].agentId = 0` and it is assumed that if the `agents[i].agentId = 0` then it is the really the same as the index (in this case `i`). However, we access `agents[1].agentId` directly when attempting to claim the grand prize. If `agents[1].agentId` is still `0` (i.e. it was never set formally to a value at any point, for example through `_swap`), then we will incorrectly use 0 as the `agentId` instead of the correct value of 1. 

This will lead to the ownership check failing while claiming the grand prize, so the winner (owner of agentId `1`) will not be able to claim:

```solidity
        uint256 agentId = agents[1].agentId;
        _assertAgentOwnership(agentId);
```

## Impact

Grand prize cannot be claimed under specific circumstances (agent 1 is the winner and `agents[1].agentId` was never changed from `0`, for example through `_swap`).

## Recommendation
You can just use `getAgent` and access the `agentId` from there instead.
