# It's possible to start a game with zero funds and zero rewards.
## Summary

It's possible to start a game with zero funds and zero rewards.

There are no checks that would disallow starting a round/game with zero funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Infiltration::`startGame()` at L521 calls method `_transferETHAndWrapIfFailWithGasLimit()` which doesnt have any checks for zero values as can be seen from below code snippet:

LowLevelWETH::`_transferETHAndWrapIfFailWithGasLimit()`, see my @audit tags below:
```solidity
    function _transferETHAndWrapIfFailWithGasLimit(
        address _WETH,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _gasLimit
    ) internal {
        bool status;

        assembly {
            status := call(_gasLimit, _to, _amount, 0, 0, 0, 0) /// @audit this can send zero `_amount` and still be successful
        }

        if (!status) {
            IWETH(_WETH).deposit{value: _amount}(); /// @audit will be able to deposit zero value successfully/wraps zero ETH into zero WETH...
            IWETH(_WETH).transfer(_to, _amount); /// @audit totally possible to deposit and transfer zero WETH. This confirms.
        }
    }
```

This effectively means that the trusted contract owner can accidentally start a new game without any funds.

## Impact

I have not confirmed yet whether the game will be able to proceed/conclude without any funds. It's likely that it will revert somewhere due to insufficient funds. (I ran out of time to check this.)

- If the game however does manage to finish(unlikely), the players would have spent their funds without any ability to win rewards.

## Recommendation

Since the contract owner is trusted, implementing zero value checks is optional but highly recommended in order to avoid accidental game starts with zero funds. There could be high severity risks involved which I did not have time to check before contest deadline.

Add a simple check in `startGame()` after L516:
```solidity
gameInfo.prizePool = balance - protocolFee;
```
Add this check after above line:
```solidity
if (gameInfo.prizePool == 0) revert Error_ZeroValue();
```
Put together:
```diff
        unchecked {
            gameInfo.prizePool = balance - protocolFee; /// @audit is the prizepool emptied/cleared/reset after each game?
        }
        
+       if (gameInfo.prizePool == 0) revert Error_ZeroValue();
```

Since I ran out of time to check this, here are some unanswered questions:

- it seems that all existing(totalSupply()) NFTs are entered into each game regardless of whether owner of NFT is participating or not?
- Is it possible to have players enter/use their NFTs in a game when rewards == 0? If yes, then at least the owner is trusted... So medium risk issue then IF game can conclude with zero funds, because players will not be able to win any rewards...
