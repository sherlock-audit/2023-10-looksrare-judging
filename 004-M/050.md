# Weak randomness in _woundRequestFulfilled can be slightly manipulated
## Summary
When the Chainlink VRF provides a random word, the function `_woundRequestFulfilled` is called.
This function chooses an agent which is alive at random, and if the agent is `Active`, it marks it as `Wounded`.
However, if the agent is already `Wounded` or `Healing`, the randomWord is modified and another agent is chosen.

The problem lies in the fact that instead of being changed entirely, `randomWord` is only incremented here. In fact `randomWord` is incremented as many times as needed to find an active agent. 
This is equivalent to checking sequentially after the first actually randomly chosen agent. This means that active agents which are right after a sequence of healed/wounded agents have more chances to be wounded in a round.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's check an extreme example:

### Prerequisites
- Currently alive agents: 100
- Alice has 40 agents, ranked from 61 to 100, in the `Wounded` state
- Bob holds the 1st agent

### Analysis
All agents from rankings 2 to 60 have 1% chance to be wounded 
Agent ranked 1 has 40%, because if any Alice's agent is chosen to be wounded, the sequential enumeration wrap around back to agent ranked 1.

## Impact
Some players with a large number of agents can manipulate the randomness to their advantage and make other users pay more to heal their agents (they are wounded more often).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use the function `_nextRandomWord()` here similarly to `_healRequestFulfilled` to choose the next agent to be hit
