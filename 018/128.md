# Bypassing MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS requirement
## Summary
Bypassing MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS requirement

## Vulnerability Detail
Every user has a restriction on minting a maximum of `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS` tokens.

```solidity
if (amountMinted > MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS) {
    revert TooManyMinted();
}
```

This requirement can be easily bypassed by everyone because it is possible to transfer tokens to anyone without checking if the recipient address already has the maximum minted tokens.

This breaks the core idea behind the restriction of allowing users to mint all possible tokens.

## Impact
Some users can have more than `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS`, which will increase their chances of winning the final prize or securing better placement for the secondary prize pool.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/Infiltration.sol#L929

```solidity
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public payable override {
        AgentStatus status = agents[agentIndex(tokenId)].status;
        if (status > AgentStatus.Wounded) {
            revert InvalidAgentStatus(tokenId, status);
        }
        super.transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if after transferring of the token to `to` address will exceed `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS` requirement.
