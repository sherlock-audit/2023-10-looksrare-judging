# `Infiltration.sol :: escape()`  Agents escaping the game will get lesser rewards than expected due to precision loss
## Summary
escape() function is used for agents to escape the game and take a part of the rewards from the pool, which is wrongly calculated and hence the agents get lesser rewards than expected.
## Vulnerability Detail
escape() function is used for agents to escape the game and take a part of the rewards from the pool, and the more participants in the game the smaller the rewards will be since the escape multiplier is smaller.
But the rewards depends upon the `_escapeMultiplier` and which has rounding errors due to division before multiplication.

The function escape() is calling internally `_escapeMultiplier()` to calculate `rewardForPlayer` as shown in the code snippet below :

```solidity
 uint256 rewardForPlayer = (totalEscapeValue * _escapeMultiplier(currentRoundAgentsAlive)) / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT_IN_BASIS_POINTS;
 ```
 
 Now if you closely see the function the multiplier is calculated with the equation which has division before multiplication which will round down the values to the nearest integer and which further will result in the agents getting lesser rewards than the expected amount.
 
 
 ```solidity
  function _escapeMultiplier(uint256 agentsRemaining) private view returns (uint256 multiplier) {
        multiplier =
            ((80 *
                ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT_IN_BASIS_POINTS_SQUARED -
                50 *
                (((agentsRemaining * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT_IN_BASIS_POINTS) / totalSupply()) ** 2)) * 100) / 
            ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT_IN_BASIS_POINTS_SQUARED;
    }
```
## Impact
Agents getting less rewards than the expected . Since there is fund loss incurred for the agents I am rating this as a high vulnerability.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommendation for the protocol is to avoid divison before multiplication and always perform division operation at last.
