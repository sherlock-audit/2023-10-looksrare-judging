# Attacker can prevent users from healing with eth
## Summary

An Attacker can manipulate the looks price and frontrun a healWithEth transaction to prevent a user from healing.

## Vulnerability Detail

The InfiltrationPeriphery contract provides a function for the user to heal with `ETH`, instead of buying `LOOKS` first.  The user has to pay an amount of eth, which will be swapped for LOOKS inside the function to heal the agent.
If the `ETH` is not enough to get the required `LOOKS` tokens, the transaction will revert.

A malicious user or attacker can use this, and frontrun an exisitng heal transaction and buy a lot of LOOKS tokens to increase the pool price.

In case the user specified, just enough, eth the transaction would revert and prevent him from healing.
In case the user wanted to avoid this and paid a bit more eth, the attacker can gain profit on this, by selling the LOOKS token for a higher price. 

## Impact

- DoS of user healing Agent
- possible Sandwich Attack
