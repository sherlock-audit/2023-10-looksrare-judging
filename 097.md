## Summary

Using `block.timestamp` as the deadline/expiry invites MEV

## Vulnerability Detail

In the smart contract, various operations involve specifying `block.timestamp` as the expiry or deadline for a given transaction. While it may be intuitive to assume that using `block.timestamp` in this context implies 'require immediate execution,' it actually means 'whatever block this transaction appears in, I'm comfortable with that block's timestamp.'

This approach opens the door to potential Miner Extractable Value (MEV) opportunities. Malicious miners can strategically hold a transaction until conditions become most favorable for their own profit. For instance, they might wait for the transaction to incur the maximum allowable slippage, take advantage of slippage parameters, or trigger other actions, such as liquidations, to their advantage.

To avoid these MEV opportunities, it is crucial to refrain from using `block.timestamp` as the deadline/expiry and instead select timestamps off-chain. Furthermore, allowing the caller to specify timestamps provides greater control and reduces the potential for unnecessary MEV exploitation.

## Impact

The impact of using `block.timestamp` as the deadline/expiry in transactions is significant:

- Exposure to Miner Extractable Value (MEV), allowing malicious miners to optimize transaction execution for their own gain.
- Potential financial losses and adverse market conditions caused by strategically delayed transactions.
- Lack of control and predictability in transaction execution, leading to operational uncertainty.

These consequences can result in financial losses and undermine the intended functionality of the smart contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate the vulnerability related to MEV exploitation, it is strongly recommended to avoid using `block.timestamp` as the deadline or expiry for transactions within the smart contract. Instead, timestamps should be selected off-chain, and callers should have the capability to specify timestamps. This approach enhances control, predictability, and security in transaction execution and reduces the potential for MEV-related issues.
