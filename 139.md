# Prevent Healing of Agents by price manipulation
## Summary

A malicious user can prevent healing by manipulating uniswap V3 pool to make heal transactions revert. 
If the next round would include less then 50 agents, and some people are trying to heal there wounded agents, they will be unfairly killed.

## Vulnerability Detail

A user can submit heal requests to heal his wounded agents, the heal request will calculate the price of the heal and try to swap WETH into LOOKs token.
```solidity
IV3SwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams({
            tokenIn: WETH,
            tokenOut: LOOKS,
            fee: POOL_FEE,
            recipient: address(this),
            amountOut: costToHealInLOOKS,
            amountInMaximum: msg.value,
            sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
        });

``` 
The transaction will revert if the output is not large enough for heal.

Any malicious user can now manipulate the price of the uniswap pool by executing a large swap, and make heal transactions revert.

This will allow any attacker to prevent a user from healing his agents, 
for example if the user decides to heal his agents just before the next round in wich they would get killed.

He also can prevent other users from healing there agents if the next round would be the top 50 round. This will kill all wounded agents, even if they still could have healed.

In both cases this will cause unfair killing of agents.

## Impact

Unfair killings of agents by price manipulation.

## Recommendation
Give user the possibility to pay with own LOOK tokens/ let him execute swap on his own
