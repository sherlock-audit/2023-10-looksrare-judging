# The agent with index 1 has greater chance to be wounded, because of the calculation
## Summary
The agent with index 1 has greater chance to be wounded, because of the calculation

## Vulnerability Detail
The randomWord can be any number from 0 to uint256(max)
In the calculation you are getting the remainder of the RandomWord divided by curentRoundAgentsAlive and then you are adding 1, which leads to greater chance for the agent 1 to be more selected.
E.g. lets say there are 2 agents left:
To be killed the first agent, the random word needs to be any number that is even, which means that can be 0, uint256(max) that there is more numbers that can be selected to be killed the first Agent.
This can be at any agents left
Because the randomWord can be 0, lead the first agent to have greater chance to be chosen 

## Impact
Greater chance to be killed, or wounded

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The Random Number must not be equal to 0
The randomWord should have range from 1 to currentRoundAgentsAlive
