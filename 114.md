# Missing zero address check for 'to' address
## Summary
Upon manual review of the `premint` function in the smart contract, it was found that the function is a missing validation check for the zero address, which is a common best practice in smart contract development to prevent tokens from being minted to an address that cannot participate in the network.
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/Infiltration.sol#L449](url)
## Vulnerability Detail
The function lacks a check to prevent minting to the zero address (`address(0)`). This could lead to a situation where tokens are minted to an unusable address, effectively locking them and reducing the circulating supply in a way that is not recoverable.
## Impact
If tokens are minted to the zero address, those tokens are permanently lost and reduce the total circulating supply of the token.
## Code Snippet
**Original function**
```solidity
function premint(address to, uint256 quantity) external payable onlyOwner {
    if (quantity * PRICE != msg.value) {
        revert InsufficientNativeTokensSupplied();
    }

    if (totalSupply() + quantity > MAX_SUPPLY) {
        revert ExceededTotalSupply();
    }

    if (gameInfo.currentRoundId != 0) {
        revert GameAlreadyBegun();
    }

    _mintERC2309(to, quantity);
}

```
**Optimized code:**
```solidity
function premint(address to, uint256 quantity) external payable onlyOwner {
    require(to != address(0), "Cannot mint to zero address");
    require(quantity * PRICE == msg.value, "Insufficient native tokens supplied");

    if (totalSupply() + quantity > MAX_SUPPLY) {
        revert ExceededTotalSupply();
    }

    if (gameInfo.currentRoundId != 0) {
        revert GameAlreadyBegun();
    }

    _mintERC2309(to, quantity);
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
require(to != address(0), "Cannot mint to zero address");
```

Adding this line will prevent the function from executing if the `to` address is the zero address, thus preventing the accidental burning of tokens.
