# Game is not fair if less round passed than 2 and agents pass under the threshold of 50 users
## Summary

Game prevents agents to heal if they haven't been wounded for at least 2 rounds (`if (currentRoundId - woundedAt < 2) { revert HealingMustWaitAtLeastOneRound();}`).
However there is a scenario where my agent is wounded, one round pass and then in next round either due to escapers or due to agents killed, `activeAgents()` number becomes less than 50 so I cannot heal anymore which is unfair due to the fact that more than 1 round passed and I was wounded in an epoch where there were more than 50 agents

## Vulnerability Detail
Multiples scenario are possible and I will try to show them here , let's suppose : 
- Alice has agent with ID 456
- We are at round 20, there are still 53 agents in the game
- At round 21 Alice can't call `heal()` due to the restriction I explained above

Here 2 scenarios are possible : 
1. At round 21 , 3 agents are killed and nobody  is healed so there are now less than 50 agents. Then `heal()` function is deactivated and Alice agent will be killed at 22 when `startNewRound` is called without a chance to heal even if he would have one.
2. At Round 21 , 2 agents were killed , there are still 51 agents. At the end of `fulfillRandomWords()`, `roundId = 22` ,  Alice wants to heal but one agent escape (because he wants to escape or maliciously by front-running Alice TX) and `agentsAlive == 50` so heal() function is no longer available , Alice agent is killed when `startNewRound` is called at round 22


So in both scenario Alice agent is killed 2 rounds after he was wounded , in a round where she should be allowed to have a chance to heal him. 
This unfair scenario is possible due to 3 things : either unfair game rules or malicious opponent or a non-malicious opponent

## Impact

Unfair game due to : 
- An agent wounded 2 rounds before number of agents pass under threshold(50) for healing has no chance to heal even if the 2 rounds delay is respected
- wounded agents at the round just before number of agents pass under threshold(50) are sentenced with no chance to survive even if they should have one

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Remove the restriction that prevents healing one round after having been wounded 
2. Store the number of agents alive when the agent is wounded and allow any user with more than 1 round wounded and with more than 50 agents at the time of the wound to have a chance to heal
