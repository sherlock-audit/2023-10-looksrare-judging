# Missing validation for agent ownership in heal() function
## Summary
Due to a missing check in the `heal()` function, a user can heal agents that he is not in possession of.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `heal()` function lacks a critical validation step to verify the ownership of the agent being healed.

## Impact
This oversight is severe because it allows any user to potentially heal (and by the associated logic, also inadvertently kill) agents without proving ownership. 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `_assertAgentOwnership(agentId);` in the for-loop inside the `heal()` function
```solidity
        for (uint256 i; i < agentIdsCount; ) {
            uint256 agentId = agentIds[i];
            _assertAgentOwnership(agentId);
            
            uint256 index = agentIndex(agentId);
            _assertAgentStatus(agents[index], agentId, AgentStatus.Wounded);

            bytes32 agentSlot = _getAgentStorageSlot(index);
            uint256 agentSlotValue;
            uint256 woundedAt;
```
