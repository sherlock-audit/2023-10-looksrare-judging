# heal can be Dossed by frontrunning - by competitor who just heal one of the victims agentsIds
## Summary
heal can be Dossed by frontrunning - by competitor who just heal one of the victim's agentsIds

## Vulnerability Detail
anyone can heal any wounded agent under the current setup. Consider the following:

1. There are 51 agents left, 25 is owned by A and 26 is owned by B. Each of them has 5 agents wounded.

2. Since there are 30 slots to heal, technically both can heal their agents, so both can send in a heal tx with all of their 5 agentIds.

3. However A would like to Doss B from healing, so he frontrun B in the `heal` tx, by intentionally healing 1 of B's agent.

4. If front-run, B's heal tx to heal all his 5 agents would revert, due to 1 of his agent has already become Active again, failing the status check.

=> A is incentivised to do so. Since even though B can find out he gets Dossed in the next round and send in heal tx agent by agent, B's heal probability for the rest of his wounded agents still drops round over round. 

```solidity
    function heal(uint256[] calldata agentIds) external nonReentrant {
        _assertFrontrunLockIsOff();

        if (gameInfo.activeAgents <= NUMBER_OF_SECONDARY_PRIZE_POOL_WINNERS) {
            revert HealingDisabled();
        }

        uint256 agentIdsCount = agentIds.length;
        _assertNotEmptyAgentIdsArrayProvided(agentIdsCount);

        uint256 currentRoundId = gameInfo.currentRoundId;
        uint16[MAXIMUM_HEALING_OR_WOUNDED_AGENTS_PER_ROUND_AND_LENGTH]
            storage healingAgentIds = healingAgentIdsPerRound[currentRoundId];
        uint256 currentHealingAgentIdsCount = healingAgentIds[0];

        uint256 newHealingAgentIdsCount = currentHealingAgentIdsCount.unsafeAdd(agentIdsCount);

        if (newHealingAgentIdsCount > MAXIMUM_HEALING_OR_WOUNDED_AGENTS_PER_ROUND) {
            revert MaximumHealingRequestPerRoundExceeded();
        }

        uint256 cost;
        uint256[] memory costs = new uint256[](agentIdsCount);

        for (uint256 i; i < agentIdsCount; ) {
            uint256 agentId = agentIds[i];

            uint256 index = agentIndex(agentId);
@> audit            _assertAgentStatus(agents[index], agentId, AgentStatus.Wounded);

```

_assertAgentStatus
```solidity
    function _assertAgentStatus(Agent storage agent, uint256 agentId, AgentStatus status) private view {
        if (agent.status != status) {
            revert InvalidAgentStatus(agentId, status);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
Heal can be frontrun to fail, because the tx revert even anyone of  agent status check fails.

## Recommendation
Allow the execution to continue on the next agent if any particular agent fails its status check.
