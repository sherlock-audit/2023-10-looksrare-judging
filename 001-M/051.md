# Healing can be used to DOS sales on secondary markets of wounded agents
## Summary
In this game agents can only be transferred when they are in the state of being `Active` or `Wounded`. This is used to enable the trading on secondary market of agents which have a reasonable chance to not be dead in the next round/already.

Since an agent with the `Healing` status has a risk of being killed in the next round, transferring such agents is disabled. However since healing of an agent can be done by anybody, anybody can block/DOS the sale of a wounded agent by healing it. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Alice wants to trade her agent which is in the state `Wounded`, so she posts an offer on her favorite marketplace.
Bob tries to buy Alice's agent, but is front-run by Charlie who heals Alice's agent, making the transfer revert.
Since this transaction is not possible anymore, Charlie can post an offer for his own agent, and have more chances of having it fulfilled.

## Impact
Some trades may be DOSed on secondary markets

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enable the transfer of healing agents, maybe taking in consideration the front-run lock (since a participant may peek at the next state of the agent and act accordingly).
