# Infiltration._killWoundedAgents eventually will revert because of block gas limit
## Summary

Infiltration._killWoundedAgents eventually will revert because of block gas limit

## Vulnerability Detail

Infiltration._killWoundedAgents function is looping through all wounded agents and does at least `woundedAgentIdsCount` amount of external calls/swaps (when all agents are not wounded). This all consumes a lot of gas and each new wounded agent increases loop size. It means that after some time `woundedAgentIdsPerRound` mapping will be big enough that the gas amount sent for function will be not enough to retrieve all data. So the function will revert.

## Impact

Function will always revert and whoever depends on it will not be able to get information.

        uint16[MAXIMUM_HEALING_OR_WOUNDED_AGENTS_PER_ROUND_AND_LENGTH]
            storage woundedAgentIdsInRound = woundedAgentIdsPerRound[roundId];
        uint256 woundedAgentIdsCount = woundedAgentIdsInRound[0];
        uint256[] memory woundedAgentIds = new uint256[](woundedAgentIdsCount);
        for (uint256 i; i < woundedAgentIdsCount; ) {
            uint256 woundedAgentId = woundedAgentIdsInRound[i.unsafeAdd(1)];


            uint256 index = agentIndex(woundedAgentId);
            if (agents[index].status == AgentStatus.Wounded) {
                woundedAgentIds[i] = woundedAgentId;
                _swap({
                    currentAgentIndex: index,
                    lastAgentIndex: currentRoundAgentsAlive - deadAgentsCount,
                    agentId: woundedAgentId,
                    newStatus: AgentStatus.Dead
                });
                unchecked {
                    ++deadAgentsCount;
                }
            }


            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }

## Tool used

Manual Review + in-house tool

## Recommendation
add some start and end indices to functions.
