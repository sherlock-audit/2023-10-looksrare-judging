# Vulnerability where the escape reward distribution loop could still run even if there are 0 agents left, leading to division by 0 errors.
## Summary
No check that activeAgentsAfterEscape is >= 1 before starting the reward distribution loop. The loop could still run with 0 agents left, leading to division by 0 errors. 
## Vulnerability Detail
there is no check that `activeAgentsAfterEscape` is >= 1 before starting the reward distribution loop in the escape() function.
This could allow the loop to run with 0 agents left, leading to a division by 0 error when calculating prizePool / currentRoundAgentsAlive.

       function escape(uint256[] calldata agentIds) external nonReentrant {

         // No check for activeAgentsAfterEscape >= 1

         uint256 activeAgentsAfterEscape = activeAgents - agentIdsCount;

         for (uint256 i; i < agentIdsCount; ) {

           uint256 totalEscapeValue = prizePool / currentRoundAgentsAlive;
    
           // This will divide by 0 if currentRoundAgentsAlive is 0

           // Rest of reward calculation

         }

         // Rest of function

       }
To prove the vulnerability:
1.	Call `escape()` with a number of `agentIds` that equals the current `activeAgents`
2.	This will set `activeAgentsAfterEscape` to 0
3.	The loop will still run, and `totalEscapeValue` will attempt to divide `prizePool` by 0

## Impact
The major impact is that the contract would become vulnerable to denial of service attacks. An attacker could repeatedly call the escape() function with no agent IDs, causing the contract to revert due to a division by zero error.
The severity is high. A denial of service vulnerability could render the contract unusable. Users would be unable to use the core functionality of escaping with their agents.

## Recommendation
This could be mitigated by adding a check at the start:

       function escape(uint256[] calldata agentIds) external nonReentrant {

         uint256 activeAgentsAfterEscape = activeAgents - agentIdsCount;

         require(activeAgentsAfterEscape >= 1, "No agents left");
  
         // Rest of function

       }

This ensures the loop cannot start if all agents have escaped, preventing the division by 0 error.
