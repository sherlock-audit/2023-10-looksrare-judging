# vulnerability that could allow an attacker to falsely claim a share of the secondary prize pool.
## Summary
The lack of validation on the provided agentId's rank allows an exploit to claim unearned secondary prizes. This can be mitigated by verifying the agentId rank is within the top 50 before awarding prizes.
Note: this vulnerability does not impact the grand prize, which has a separate claim function and correctly verifies game completion and ownership. But it could allow falsely claiming large shares of the secondary prize pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract does not validate that the provided agentId is actually ranked in the top 50 before awarding secondary prize shares. This is a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to falsely claim a share of the secondary prize pool.
The relevant code is in the `claimSecondaryPrizes()` function:

       function claimSecondaryPrizes(uint256 agentId) external nonReentrant {
        // No check that agentId is actually in top 50

         uint256 placement = agentIndex(agentId);
         _assertValidPlacement(placement);

         // Award share based on placement
         // ...
       }

The problem is that `agentIndex(agentId)` simply returns the index of the agent in the mapping, regardless of whether it is actually a top ranked agent.
An attacker could simply provide any arbitrary agentId, and would be awarded a share based on its index. For example, an attacker with agent #100 could call `claimSecondaryPrizes(100)` and receive a share meant for a top ranked agent.

## Impact
Attackers could drain the secondary prize pool by claiming shares for inactive or non-top ranked agents. This would prevent legitimate top-ranked agents from claiming their rightful secondary prize shares.
I would classify this as a high severity issue since it impacts the core functionality of distributing secondary prizes correctly. Allowing unauthorized agents to claim prize shares breaks the core rules and incentives of the game.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract should add a check that the provided agentId is actually within the top NUMBER_OF_SECONDARY_PRIZE_POOL_WINNERS agents by rank. For example:
solidity

       function claimSecondaryPrizes(uint256 agentId) external nonReentrant {

         // Only agents ranked 1-50 are eligible
         require(agentIndex(agentId) <= NUMBER_OF_SECONDARY_PRIZE_POOL_WINNERS, "Agent not ranked in top 50");
  
         // Rest of function
       }
This would prevent an attacker from claiming shares for arbitrary agentIds that are not actually top ranked
