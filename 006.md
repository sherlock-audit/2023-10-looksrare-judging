# `POOL_FEE` is hardcoded which will lead to significant losses compared to optimal routing
## Summary
In [InfiltrationPeriphery.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/InfiltrationPeriphery.sol#L19C29-L19C37), `POOL_FEE` is hardcoded, which reduce significantly the possibilities and will lead to non optimal routes.
## Vulnerability Detail
- [POOL_FEE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/InfiltrationPeriphery.sol#L19) is hardcoded = `3_000 (0.3%)` and is used in the [heal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/InfiltrationPeriphery.sol#L45-L51) function and the [costToHeal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-infiltration/contracts/InfiltrationPeriphery.sol#L78C14-L85) function.
- The main issue is the assumption and usage of the 0,3% fee pool regardless of asset. Those that are familiar with UniV3 will know that there are multiple pool tiers for the same asset pair.  Hence, it is possible that there are other pools (Eg. the pool with 0.1% fee) where majority of the liquidity lies instead.
- Therefore using the current implementation would create a significant loss of revenue.
## Impact
`POOL_FEE` is hardcoded, which reduce significantly the possibilities and will lead to non optimal routes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enable skipping conversion for some assets, and have a mapping of the pool fee as part of the customisable configuration so that pools with the best liquidity can be used.
