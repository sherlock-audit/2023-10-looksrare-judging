# Chainlink VRF variables are hardcoded
## Summary
When interacting with the Chainlink VRF, the code utilizes constant variables for minimumRequestConfirmations and callbackGasLimit. These variables are verified within the Chainlink VRF contract. However, the validation criteria for these variables can be modified by the VRF contract administrator. If these criteria are altered such that they are incompatible with the current hardcoded values, the game will not function as intended.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the chainlink `requestRandomWords` function triggered the values for `callbackGasLimit` and `minimumRequestConfirmations` are hardcoded. Those values are validated inside the chainlink function and can be changed to different values via the chainlink admin. If chainlink decides to change those values in an unfavorable value that would make the game to be unable to call chainlink due to validation reverts then the game will be stuck.

Example:
Assume that the chainlinks `s_config.minimumRequestConfirmations` storage variable is set to 5 by chainlink owner. Since the game contract calls the chainlink VFR as follows:
```solidity
uint256 requestId = VRF_COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords({
            keyHash: KEY_HASH,
            subId: SUBSCRIPTION_ID,
            minimumRequestConfirmations: uint16(3),
            callbackGasLimit: uint32(2_500_000),
            numWords: uint32(1)
        });
```
the transaction will revert because of the `minimumRequestConfirmations`(3) is lesser than the `s_config.minimumRequestConfirmations`(5)

**Another scenario focusing on the callback gas limit:**
If we take this scenario #4 there can be 800+ wounded agents and the probability of this loop looping more than "x" times such that the callback gas limit is not enough is pretty possible
```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < woundedAgentsCount; ) {
            uint256 woundedAgentIndex = (randomWord % currentRoundAgentsAlive).unsafeAdd(1);
            Agent storage agentToWound = agents[woundedAgentIndex];

            if (agentToWound.status == AgentStatus.Active) {
                // This is equivalent to
                // agentToWound.status = AgentStatus.Wounded;
                // agentToWound.woundedAt = roundId;
                assembly {
                    let agentSlotValue := sload(agentToWound.slot)
                    agentSlotValue := and(
                        agentSlotValue,
                        // This is equivalent to
                        // or(
                        //     TWO_BYTES_BITMASK,
                        //     shl(64, TWO_BYTES_BITMASK)
                        // )
                        0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffff000000000000ffff
                    )
                    // AgentStatus.Wounded is 1
                    agentSlotValue := or(agentSlotValue, shl(AGENT__STATUS_OFFSET, 1))
                    agentSlotValue := or(agentSlotValue, shl(AGENT__WOUNDED_AT_OFFSET, roundId))
                    sstore(agentToWound.slot, agentSlotValue)
                }

                uint256 woundedAgentId = _agentIndexToId(agentToWound, woundedAgentIndex);
                woundedAgentIds[i] = woundedAgentId;

                unchecked {
                    ++i;
                    currentRoundWoundedAgentIds[i] = uint16(woundedAgentId);
                }

                // @audit randomWord = uint256(keccak256(abi.encode(randomWord)));
                randomWord = _nextRandomWord(randomWord);
            } else {
                // If no agent is wounded using the current random word, increment by 1 and retry.
                // If overflow, it will wrap around to 0.
                unchecked {
                    ++randomWord;
                }
            }
        }
```
assuming 10000 agents alive and 892 wounded the probability of hitting an agent that is wounded is 892/10000 although that in such scenario the randomWord is incremented by ++ would possibly make things easier (it tries to look the closest sample) it is still has a chance to loop more than the required callback gas limit.
## Impact
I will label this as high for the following reasons:

1- Sherlock page for the contest states:
> In case of external protocol integrations, are the risks of external contracts pausing or executing an emergency withdrawal acceptable? If not, Watsons will submit issues related to these situations that can harm your protocol's functionality.
> 
> Yes they are acceptable

2- This issue will make the game to stop and there are no fixes then emergency withdraw

3- Looks team does not have control on chainlink

4- Chainlink might see an issue with the current value and they mandatory set the new value higher than 3 for security purposes meaning that they can not lower it down for Looks team even if they wanted to

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make setters functions for the values that can be changed by chainlink admin
