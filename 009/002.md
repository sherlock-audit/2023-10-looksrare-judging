# `Infiltration.heal()` doesn't check for agent ownership
## Summary
In the `heal()` function of the `Infiltration` contract, user provided agents are not checked for ownership.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `heal()` function, agents are only checked for their status and length, but not ownership. Any user can heal any agents.

## Impact
Despite calling the function costs caller prices and doesn't benefit caller at all, it can still affect the overall game plan/order for other users.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        for (uint256 i; i < agentIdsCount; ) {
            uint256 agentId = agentIds[i];

            uint256 index = agentIndex(agentId);
            _assertAgentStatus(agents[index], agentId, AgentStatus.Wounded);

            bytes32 agentSlot = _getAgentStorageSlot(index);
            uint256 agentSlotValue;
            uint256 woundedAt;
```


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check for ownership at the beginning of the loop.
