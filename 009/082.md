# [M-01] Allows Unauthorized Healing Due to Missing Ownership Check
## Summary
`Infiltration::heal`  function in the contract lacks an ownership check, allowing any user to attempt healing on agents without verifying ownership. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized users interfering with the agent healing process, potentially causing imbalances in the game's dynamics and compromising fairness and security.

## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
 function heal(uint256[] calldata agentIds) external nonReentrant {
        _assertFrontrunLockIsOff();

        if (gameInfo.activeAgents <= NUMBER_OF_SECONDARY_PRIZE_POOL_WINNERS) {
            revert HealingDisabled();
        } ...      

        for (uint256 i; i < agentIdsCount; ) {
            uint256 agentId = agentIds[i];  // @audit not ownership check
            
            uint256 index = agentIndex(agentId);
            _assertAgentStatus(agents[index], agentId, AgentStatus.Wounded);
          ...
}
```
`Infiltration::heal` allows anyone to call it, without checking the agentIDs own by msg.sender. This can lead to potential exploits and disruptions in gameplay. Here's an example of how it can be exploited:

Scenario:

User A owns agents with IDs: [1, 2, 3]
User B wants to heal their agents but does not own agents 1, 2, or 3.
Exploit:

User B calls the heal function with the agent IDs [1, 2, 3].
Since the function does not check ownership, it proceeds to attempt healing these agents.
Impact:

Agents 1, 2, and 3 will go through the healing process, even though they do not belong to User B.
This could lead to an imbalance in the game, with unauthorized users gaining benefits they shouldn't have.

By healing agents not owned, User B could influence the overall state of the game, potentially causing unintended consequences.

## Impact
The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to interfere with the agent healing process, potentially leading to imbalances, disruptions, and unfair advantages in the game.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only allow owner of agentIDs to heal:
```javascript
 function heal(uint256[] calldata agentIds) external nonReentrant {
        _assertFrontrunLockIsOff();

        if (gameInfo.activeAgents <= NUMBER_OF_SECONDARY_PRIZE_POOL_WINNERS) {
            revert HealingDisabled();
        } ...      

        for (uint256 i; i < agentIdsCount; ) {
            uint256 agentId = agentIds[i];  
+           _assertAgentOwnership(agentId);   // add ownership check
            uint256 index = agentIndex(agentId);
            _assertAgentStatus(agents[index], agentId, AgentStatus.Wounded);
          ...
}
```
