# Funds may remain locked forever in InfiltrationPeriphery contract.
## Summary
`InfiltrationPeriphery` is able to receive ETH but there is no withdrawing functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
`InfiltrationPeriphery` contract has `receive()` function which is marked as payable and anyone is able to send ETH to this contract intentionally or by mistake.

## Impact
Since there is no withdrawing functionality, all funds that are send directly to the contract without the heal function will remain locked forever but cannot withdraw it.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement withdrawing functionality, so if a user mistakenly sends funds to this contract, they can be withdrawn.
