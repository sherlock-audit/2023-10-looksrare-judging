# Bypass of  MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS Limit due to no Premint Checks
## Summary

`premint()` function allows an owner to mint any number of agents to any user.
Even if owner is trusted , user which is pre-minted to is not trusted, then any user should not be allowed to mint more than `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS`. 
To ensure this check there is a mapping : `mapping(address minter => uint256 amount) public amountMintedPerAddress;` .
However this mapping is not accounted when admin premint to user, rendering this accounting useless and then leading to a condition where an address could exceed the intended minting limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
Scenario : 
Let's imagine `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS = 50`

- Alice know the owner Bob and tell him to mint her 45 Agents, Bob say ok because 45 < 50 so limit is respected.
- Alice see an opportunity to win the game and when minting start, she mints 50 agents 
- Alice now has 95 agents whereas `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS = 50`

### POC
Add this test on Infiltration.mint.t.sol : 
```solidity
function test_Finding_premint_And_Mint_Bypas_MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS() public {
        uint256 QUANTITY = MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS - 1;
        _setMintPeriod();
        vm.deal(owner, PRICE * QUANTITY);
        vm.prank(owner);
        infiltration.premint{value: PRICE * QUANTITY}({to: user1, quantity: QUANTITY});

        assertEq(owner.balance, 0);
        assertEq(IERC721A(address(infiltration)).balanceOf(user1), QUANTITY);

        vm.deal(user1, PRICE * MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS);
        vm.warp(_mintStart());
        vm.prank(user1);

        infiltration.mint{value: PRICE * MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS}({quantity: MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS});
        assertEq(IERC721A(address(infiltration)).balanceOf(user1), MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS - 1);
        uint256 balanceUser1 = IERC721A(address(infiltration)).balanceOf(user1);
        console.log("Max Mint : %s, balanceUser1 : %s",MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS,balanceUser1);
        vm.warp(_mintEnd() + 1 seconds);
    }
```

## Impact

- Alice as almost 2 more chance than any user to win the game => unfair for other users 
- break/bypass of one of the core invariant of the game

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Even if owner can bypass the `MAX_MINT_PER_ADDRESS` as seen in tests, user should be accounted of how many owner pre-minted for him/her, to not abuse owner  : 
```solidity
    function premint(address to, uint256 quantity) external payable onlyOwner {
        if (quantity * PRICE != msg.value) {
            revert InsufficientNativeTokensSupplied();
        }

        if (totalSupply() + quantity > MAX_SUPPLY) {
            revert ExceededTotalSupply();
        }

        if (gameInfo.currentRoundId != 0) {
            revert GameAlreadyBegun();
        }
+      amountMintedPerAddress[to] += amountMinted; 
        _mintERC2309(to, quantity);
    }
```
